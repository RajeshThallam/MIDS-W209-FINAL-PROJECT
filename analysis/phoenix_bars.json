Such a great old building, and I was so happy they were finally doing something with it. I've watched progress in person and in pictures, as well as chatted about it with my friends, and three years later it is finally something.\n\nThe inside of the building is beautiful. Absolutely stunning. They did a great job with the old department store, and utilized a lot of space very efficiently. There are some neat touches here and there, one being the empty elevator shaft with a plexiglass cover, and some mirrors so you can seemingly see forever. It's not that deep! The restrooms upstairs (shame they are ALL upstairs) are awesome, in a white room surrounded with mirrors. I felt like I was in a padded asylum with mirrors, the asylum because I couldn't figure the place out. There is a DJ booth above the front door that is very easy to miss, and really a cool touch. The colors are all browns to keep with the nostalgic theme, and did I mention there are mirrors everywhere? The building and space get a 5. It's just cool.\n\nWe sat at the bar and were followed by a friendly little asian guy, with menus and he seemed genuinely interested in us having a good experience. He was previously across the street asking people to come over and try the restaurant. I wish I could say the bartender was half as friendly or committed to his job. The bald one was extremely unfriendly, seemed very arrogant, and for a person in a loud restaurant should practice his vocal skills. The service was prompt without mishaps throughout, but very cold.\n\nI ordered the Carne Pizza. I have to say, it was one of the biggest disappointments I have had in a loooooong time. I have made better pizzas in my home oven that came from a box. Honestly... it had a paper thin cardboard like crust, no quality toppings, and not exactly a memorable taste. It tasted fine, and that was it's only redeeming quality. My neighbor had the roast beef sandwich and it was no better, or higher quality. The deli counter at Safeway can make a better sandwich. I earlier chastised someone for judging food on opening night, but now I see it really is bad, there is really no quality.  No sandwiches come with sides. No fries, no fruit, no salad, nothing. They are about $10, and if I want a great sandwich for $10 I'll go to Switch, and it will come with a great Caesar Salad on the side.\n\nThis is not a restaurant, but rather a bar that serves food. If I think of it like that... more like a bigger version of The Roosevelt, I can think a little more positive about this, but not much. Bad service, bad food, bad review. I'll not be coming back, even with the walking distance proximity. It's just not worth it, especially for the price, and to feel like a not busy staff doesn't want to be busy. We are now at the point where there are other options downtown that are better. It's no longer a Downtown where you can be mediocre and survive.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6imLt53br7SJ3av07jjH7w"}

You have to check it out for all the interesting features like the elevator shaft, which everyone got a kick out of as they walked by, to the bathrooms that have a little confused about how to actually get into one of them.\nIt seems they have improved their menu as the Pork Calabrease (or something along those lines) came with onion string side and two slices of cantaloupe and tomatoes halves. My girlfriend got the Bruschetta and we both found our meals to taste great, we both agreed we would go back just for the food alone. I also had a Russin Mule cocktail which was excellent. The music was also great, had a very \"big city\" sound to it...maybe something you'd hear in San Francisco or the like.\nA couple of down sides were that the place seems to have a bit of a identity crisis. It's set up as a restaurant, but really there isn't that much food on the menu. It would make a great lounge with the music they have, but there aren't enough lounging seating areas...it's all dining height tables and chairs.

The design, decor + ambiance will feel somewhat familiar, as will the quality of drinks at the bar (aside from much smaller martinis) - but the food at Hanny's is a strange departure from the top-notch bar food found at it's sister restaurant in Scottsdale.\n\nWhile still bar food, Hanny's offers an odd assortment of pizzas, sandwiches and salads. And not a big assortment, either. Everything we tried tasted OK, but sounded better on the menu than it actually was. Portions were also disappointing for the price, especially the chopped salad, which was half the size of the chopped at AZ88 - and half as good - for about the same price. \n\nThe oven-fired pizzas had a nice thin, crispy crust, but toppings were just so-so and felt uninspired. Sandwich selections were more inspired, but only slightly appealing, from Charred Pork to the P.A.T., a fancy BLT made with pancetta and arugula. The Bar Plate was probably our favorite item, though still just OK - fresh prosciutto (sliced at the bar on a very cool Euro-style slicer), chunks of parmigiano-reggiano, slices of melon, and ciabatta bread - good, but nothing to write home about.\n\nWhat is worth writing about is the place itself - a must-see, and just what downtown needed. Sleek, urban and the coolest industrial rehabbing around - from the clever open elevator shaft to the maze of bathroom stalls. And once the rooftop patio and basement lounge open, this place will surely be the hottest spot in town.\n\nAs for now, stop in, check it out, have a drink or two or three, and enjoy the beginning of a new era for downtown Phoenix.

The question is...will it ever achieve it ?? \n\n I applaud the \"vision\" of Karl Kopp, I feel he preserved the original architectural elements of the building, while finally catapulting the central Phoenix's bar /restaurant scene into 2008.  Finally an upscale restaurant and bar that actually looks like money went into the renovation... Ikea purchased items were not identified here.   \n\nThe main \"lobby\" bar/restaurant on the first floor is huge... anchored by a large square bar in the center of the room... the ceiling soars above... a perfect space for an art installation.  The room is basically divided into a 60/40 bar/dining area with the main focus on the bar area.  \n\nSpeaking of the bar area... strange place... although the seating at the bar is exceptional, several standard bar features are missing... The standard visual liquor selection is nowhere to be found, and the bartender was at a loss for the choices of vodka.  I'm not sure where they bought their martini glasses... they are NOTHING close to the \"birdbath\" martini  size of AZ88...perhaps someone confused the martini glass order and shipped out eye wash cups... I'm thinking that these are not the standard size  and it was all just a very evil joke! (Hint... if you enjoy olives in your martini... order them on the side.  Once  the spear of olives is removed from the drink,  the drink then becomes half empty... exzageration?  fabrication? Order one and decide for yourself)\n\nSpeaking of size..check out the enormous medieval torture device in the center of the bar... oh wait... I'm sorry... it's an industrial size prosciutto slicer.. Silly me.  Bevnaps where never used, perhaps they have not been stocked yet?? \n\nThe restaurant table service was spotty, if not aloof.  This type of attitude works great after the restaurant opens and introduces the red rope / bouncer.. my opinion... first learn how to wait on tables, then concentrate on affecting (or should I say...perfecting) the attitude.  \n\nThe \"deconstructed\" prosciutto and melon plate we ordered was nothing special, the crisp bread pizza type app was ok.. again, nothing exciting here.  Well, that's not true.. as there IS something exciting in this bar... The bathroom area on the mezzanine level!!.. mirrors and white hot lighting ensures that if you look \"good\" in that lighting... you'll look \"GREAT\" in the soft lighting of the bar area.  \n\nThe balcony seating area in my opinion would be better used as a low seating area rather than a dining area. One can only hope that the upper floors will be used for live music and outdoor seating.  The basement should be opening soon, potentially a moshpit dance area? Who knows..  If you've been to Swigg in Santa Fe, you'll feel right at home here... Check it out, give it a try... or wait until they \"weed out\" the bad help and get the place up to speed.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6imLt53br7SJ3av07jjH7w"}

After meeting with 2 of the most bad ass Yelpers at our place- Stevey P and Mr. K- we headed out to Hanny's to meet with more of Yelp's best- Bonnie G., Erica O., and Lauren V. Hanny's proved to be a fun and interesting place for us to relax. \n\nWe didn't try any of the food since we had eaten earlier but we sampled the drinks and explored the space. I ordered up a mojito, which came with an unexpected dark rum float on the top. It was strong on the liquor but not on the mint. Perhaps next time I'll try a mai tai. After that I sampled a drink brought over from AZ88, the Moscow Mule, which was very nice and refreshing. The bar area is nice and large, the bartenders friendly. The prosciutto slicer in the middle is, um, well its odd. \n\nThe space is incredible. There are so many areas to explore, nooks and crannies to find. Some are cool (room of light and mirrors, white room, upstairs balcony, front part of the upstairs that overlooks Adams) some are creepy (the elevator shaft freaked me out, the stairs up to who knows where\u00e2) However, its clear that the space was a department store. The central bar on the main floor was obviously the cosmetics counter and my husband kept getting whiffs of a floral smell, which I have to assume was the ghost of a crazy perfume lady past. \n\nI think Hanny's has great potential...there are no other places like it downtown. It just needs people. So please, everyone go there. When do you hear me say that in a Yelp review? Never. But Hanny's is within walking distance of my place and could be a great destination downtown when one wants to enjoy a night at a nice lounge.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6imLt53br7SJ3av07jjH7w"}

Here's hoping that things pick up and word of mouth spreads! \n\nThe service was GREAT and while the menu is totally different than AZ88 (as it should be), it keeps to the concept of very well prepared, simple foods.

The space itself is really amazing, and they did something really cool with the way they kept the original aesthetic and fit a restaurant right in.  But it's in this weird space between \"club\" and \"restaurant\", and I think they just need to decide which one they'd rather be.\n\nWe had really, really bad service, too.

My guess is that this place is aimed to give those (middle aged) people a sense of \"the big city\" and that it does. It strives to have a mature hip feel, the dinning room employs the newly popular community seating (i.e. you could find yourself sharing a bench/table with the couple right next to you), and they have a DJ playing trance music while you dine. They succeed in that regard. This does have an old skewl slightly upscale \"metro\" feel to it.\n\nThe Food: \nA very sparse menu, I had the carne pizza which had GREAT thin crust but lacked much flavor.\n\nThe service:\nThe service staff is where they REALLY fail. You can go to places like FEZ, Cibo, or Pallete and it's instantaneously clear that you are being served by PROFESSIONALS. Not so much here, quite the opposite actually. Our service was what I expect from a breakfast dinner or The Waffle House (the waitress was FAR to casual for a place like this, i.e. it was kinda a like \"so watcha want?\" kinda thing going on). And honestly, with the current unemployment rate, as well as the location and style of this place, it's completely unacceptable to me.\n\nSo if your looking for poor service in Downtown now you have three choices: Carly's, Breadfruit and now Hanny's\n\nAll-in-all ...

A friend and I met up for drinks there last Friday, and lingered for around 5 hours (another friend was flying in from NYC and his flight was delayed several times, so the rounds kept coming). \n\nSeveral people have commented negatively on the service, lighting or music, but they must be working out the kinks with all of the above because they were spot-on during our visit. The DJ was spinning a combination of subtle vibe-enducing music mixed with \"oh, I LOVE this song\" uncovered and unexpected old favorites. The lighting gradually shifting during the evening, so that by midnight it was a cozy and romantic mood. \n\nSpeaking of, let me just say it: something about this place just felt...sexy. I don't know if it was the music, the lighting, the \"baby it's cold outside\" week before Christmas, or my malbec-shiraz. The things-could-happen-here feel especially hit me when I went upstairs and saw the unisex restrooms all lined up; white unmarked doors all in a row to their own little rooms -- it was straight out of a Madonna video circa 1995! \n\nBiggest watchout: the martini glasses were offensively and ridiculously tiny. I mean, really?!? I had read about this in reviews before going, but I was so shocked at the size that I refused to order one and stuck with wine (which I wouldn't say was a \"healthy\" pour, but at least took me more than 4 sips to finish). The menu is also relatively limited. We shared the bar plate and a prosciutto pizza (added mushrooms) and enjoyed both, but neither were outstanding or very filling. \n\nAll-in-all, I will definitely recommend this place to friends for drinks or drinks/apps. It's a unique space with a great vibe and I am sure it will do well once word gets out.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6imLt53br7SJ3av07jjH7w"}

The server - like last time, was charged with serving an amorphous group of fast drinkers who kept wandering off to take pictures, play in the elevator shaft or slide on the tongue couch - excelled. Patient, friendly and informative. In fact, when some drinks erroneously landed on one person's tab - there were several separate checks at our table - she removed them without awkwardness or even so much as an eye roll.\nMusic neither impressed nor (more importantly) annoyed - mostly soul and R&B mixes - and the disappearing/reappearing DJ trick is a good one. I was almost talked into moving the party to the District, where I was told beers were $3 and the atmosphere was something I might enjoy. Glad I didn't (esp. after reading some of the yelp reviews for it!) \nHanny's, I will continue to make the effort to come to your establishment, which is neither close to me or easy to: find/send people to/park around.

And on the last day of December 2008, of all days. 2008 was a great year for Phoenix Yelp but not for Phoenix itself as one local business after another closed its doors and efforts to revitalize downtown didn't do so well. Anyone who attended the downtown pub crawl can attest to that. \n\nI really believe that 2009 can be a better year for Phoenix, though, and I think that the light rail being open (and creating a flow up and down the central corridor) will definitely help. The other thing I think will help is entrepreneurs like Karl Kopp (the owner of Hanny's) being willing to take risks and open businesses that may not necessarily fit the cookie cutter mold of what a \"cool\" Phoenix establishment should be. I really applaud him for that. \n\nIn some sense, opening a business that's different than what people are used to or expect helps you create a cult following--not everyone will like you, but if enough people refuse to listen to the other people who don't like you, you will create a pretty passionate crowd of supporters. I really think that Hanny's will gain this type of cult following and then over time, as similar types of businesses gain a footing in Phoenix, it will become a place everyone accepts. Or that won't happen and I'll pray that enough people start to see the magic so that Hanny's won't be the next business to close!\n\nIn case you think that I only like Hanny's because it's different or new, I want to emphasize that I also really liked the food and drinks my husband and I tried. Yes, the martinis were small (my husband had the special Hanny's martini with vodka and gin and I had a French martini), but they were mixed well and at only $5, my husband's was well priced for the size. \n\nWe also both thought the food was really well executed. We especially loved the pizza with prosciutto and arugula. The crust was definitely too thin even for \"Roman style\"--having been to Rome five times, I can tell you that the crust there has a bit more substance to it, but the ingredients on Hanny's pizza were simple and fresh, which I know to be an authentically Italian approach to pizza making. But I can see how you might be disappointed if you are used to very saucy and savory pizza. The pork loin sandwich was also really good--the thinly sliced pork was very flavorful and the bread was nice and crusty. The green peppers were a bit strange, though, as they made the pork taste more Mexican inspired than Italian. \n\nThat being said, though, I'm kind of content overall to not try to force Hanny's into a box. What I like about the place is its slight imperfections and its inability to be easily defined. Is it a bar? a restaurant? a lounge? I don't really know, but I don't really care. I think its unique character make it a great destination for those who are looking for something different in Phoenix, and I hope that it survives the economic slump that the city has been going through. If it does, maybe it will expand its offerings and become a place that everyone can appreciate.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6imLt53br7SJ3av07jjH7w"}

The modern elements and atmosphere is different than any other place I have visited in Phoenix. The bar is large and central and there are plenty of places to sit, lounge, hide, or socialize. The restrooms are upstairs, which could be troublesome as the night progresses, but thankfully they do have an elevator for those of use who are not steady on heels after a few drinks. The service at the bar was slow, but it was busy and having good company helped me forget that I was without drink. The long islands are strong, very strong, 2 day hang over strong- but they did the trick. \n\nHanny's is the type of place I would take out of town friends to show them that Phoenix is a city on the rise and not just a Hard Rock Cafe and Hooters type of town.

The building, design, and decor at Hanny's are amazing.  The menu and service, not so much.\n\nI'm pretty sure it was our waiter's first night serving tables - many awkward uncomfortable moments.  I ordered a $5 martini and received a half full martini glass.  Next time I will ask if I can order two at the same time and just pour them in the same glass.\n\nWe ordered the bruschetta appetizer.  The topping came in a bowl with some thin dry strips of bread around it.  The topping itself was tasty - my recommendation is for the Hanny's chef to take a trip to Postino and check out their bruschetta bread - thick and soft with crusty edges.  I found the dinner menu to be lacking in choices.  Nothing really looked good so I ordered a pizza which left me underwhelmed.  Soggy and flavorless.  \n\nMy suggestion to Hanny's is to think about the successful AZ/88 combination of good simple meals combined with strong fancy drinks.  Get somebody who knows how to make an Italian style wood oven pizza with crisp burnt edges.  And I don't think anybody will mind if a few of the menu items are the same as at AZ - in particular some good burgers.\n\nGood luck with the changes - the debt service on that building must be enormous, and I would hate to see it shut down.\n\n***UPDATE***  Been back several times since initial review - Pizza was much better (i.e. crispy) and the $5 martinis have grown on me - two drinks at AZ88 and I need a cab - not so at Hanny's.

It's the type of lounge you'd expect to find in LA, Manhattan, or some other metropolitan city. Being that I just moved back to Phoenix from LA, I was pleasantly surprised and relieved to find something that would help my transition from the City of Angels.\n\nTo be completely honest, you go to Hanny's for the atmosphere and the drinks. The food isn't great but the salads and appetizers are decent. I've yet to try out much of the drink menu but the gin and tonic as well as the gimlets that they make are pretty solid. That being said, the bartenders are really cool guys and make sure you're taken care of. The DJ's that spin on the weekends are also pretty good; however, they play alot of ambient or lounge type music so don't go there and expect to cut a rug like at Homme.\n\nOverall, this place is pretty spot on to take a date or just to chill out. Hanny's is truly a rare find in Phoenix and I hope to stop by more often.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6imLt53br7SJ3av07jjH7w"}

My chopped salad was good (well as good as a salad could get).  The pizzas were good and friends enjoyed those.  But unfortunately the sandwiches were lacking.   The meats were overdone completely and the bacon seemed to turn to dust once bitten into-- YUCK!  I don't even think the guys even ate the sandwiches.  They told the server that they were not good and didn't want new ones since they were eating the pizza instead from others at our table.  They took the sandwiches off the bill once they knew they were not happy with them.  I think this is standard practice especially if the food wasn't eaten.  ( sidenote** I hate when people eat the entire meal and then complain that they didn't like it and then expect it taken on the bill--- don't eat it if it was that bad.)\n\nHanny's is a very cool atmosphere and fun and hip, I would definitely return for drinks and I want to try out the pizzas next time.  I'll go again.\n\nI am sure you already heard about the swanky bathrooms and elevator and all that jazz so I won't go into it.  My only problem with the bathrooms was that there was no place for me to put my coat.... that sucked and the soap dispenser involved having to pick it up and squeeze it into my hand (it was a clear ketchup squeezer with the tip), I hate touching more things than I need to in a public bathroom.

There were about 15 upstairs staring at us, about 5 at the bar, and 15 or so more servers just chillin around the restaurant.

We need more elegant dining options downtown, and the idea of operating such a restaurant inside this classic old department store sounds too irresistible. After eating lunch there with my spouse, I'd say that they succeeded, for the most part.\n\nWe arrived at about 12:30 on a Friday. The place was mostly deserted. In this case, it was OK since the staff performed extra attentively. All three of the women who served us were extremely nice and helpful. Honestly, I didn't get any of the haughtiness that other yelpers noticed in that department.\n\nWe both ordered pizzas. While waiting for our lunch, we explored the upstairs and the plexiglass covered elevator shaft. The bathroom area looked like something out of 2001: A Space Odyssey. Thankfully, they didn't totally gut what made the department store so unique. Pretty neat! \n\nAs the food arrived, I was surprised to find the pizzas are actually a good size for a filling meal. The food was perfectly prepared and priced fairly. Personally, I love thin crust pizza, and for that reason the meal did not disappoint. My partner even needed a doggie bag. We also had glasses of water served in \"piss elegant\" thin glasses, but at least the staff were attentive enough to give us plenty of refills.\n\nWhat about the atmosphere? The dining room was beautifully appointed with leather and marble tabletops, but on the whole it seemed cold and echoey. Sometimes it felt like we were dining in a tomb. I imagine this place is a lot more inviting at night, with a full house.\n\nAll in all, it was a good but not thrilling dining experience. I would recommend that the curious at least give this place a try. The only complaint I have, like the others here, is the limited menu. Aside from pizza, they only serve 3 or 4 varieties of unexciting sandwiches and salads. It's the one thing that keeps me from giving Hanny's a four star rating. There IS some good news, however. Staffers told us that, starting tonight (5/22), they will be serving an expanded menu. The only deletion was a sandwich served on an English muffin that looked too expensive, anyway.

For dinner, I ordered the veggie pizza - which seemed flavorless.

The service is very friendly, if not always the most prompt. The food is...well, it's nothing memorable. Their \"bruschetta\" is really more like an olive tapenade, with crostini on the side. When I asked a friend how he liked Hanny's, he said, \"It's good, but a little oily.\" I thought, \"what?!\" but I understood what he meant when I saw and tasted the crostini. And then came the prosciutto pizza. While I loved the thin crust, the nice sauce, the prosciutto, arugala, and fresh shaved parmigiano-reggiano, the cheese was also super oily. Bring the Tums, people. Dessert was the biggest flop of all. The lemon meringue tart had almost no lemon at all. It was basically warm, runny meringue (which the waitress said had just been freshly made...obviously not well) on a crust. It was like it was missing a whole layer of lemon filling. Hanny's will be a cool place to hang out and grab a drink after Suns or D-backs games, but it's not a place to go to for the food.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6imLt53br7SJ3av07jjH7w"}

It's a great addition to the downtown Phoenix scene, both for during the day and at night. There is plenty of parking around Hanny's, albeit at meters, but if you go at night the meters turn off at 8 pm. The space is open, so you can definitely tell it was a department store in its previous life. The elevator shaft still freaks me out everytime I go and I am still confused a bit by the bathrooms, although I am not sure if it's because they are trendy or if because I usually have been drinking when I need to go upstairs for the bathroom.\n\nI've had lunch twice now at Hanny's and have sampled both one of the sandwiches - the BLT Supremo (it is a BLT with hard boiled egg and cheese)- and a pizza - Bianco. While I loved my sandwich, I was very underwhelmed by the pizza. However, I am not a fan of thin crust pizza, so that is probably the reason why. The sandwich was a nice size and they cooked the bacon perfectly for me. The sandwich came with some onion straws, so that satisfied my fried food guilty pleasure. \n\nPrices at Hanny's are, for the most part, really reasonable. The pizza, which is a nice size, was $11, and the sandwich was around $8 or so. I've only bought beer to drink, but my Stella Artois on Friday night was $5. Domestic beers looked to run around $3-4. I have found the service at the bar to be fast, but table service during lunch to be pretty slow and non-attentive.

This was the best decision we could have made for the following reasons:\na) We discovered the mirrored hallway and pink walls. \nb) We also discovered the sexiest bathrooms alive.\n3) I would've never known about the swanky reclining booth seating upstairs that was set away from everything else. \n\nUpon heading downstairs I inquired about the upstairs. I was told it was usually saved for when the downstairs was full, but upon stating it was my birthday party, we were kindly allowed upstairs. We ended up having enough people for 2-3 booths so this was great.\n\nThe waiter started out great at first. Refilling water and being patient on the rest of our crowd to arrive. When we all got the point where it was time to order, things started getting confusing and the service started becoming very slow. I received the wrong pizza. I was able to finally get the right one after a little discussion and time, but by the time that happened I had been munching on other things and it was also close to when we were leaving so I had to box it all. Good part? It still tasted delicious for dinner tonight. When the time to get our checks came it got insanely confusing and several people had the wrong items on their checks and had to get a new check printed several times. \n\nThe food menu is limited and the service is slow, so I'm not sure I'd return here for dinner again, but I won't say I will never go back. Their drink menu is AMAZING. I was so excited to see such a great list of champagne cocktails and other items. The place is also insanely sexy.

I won't lie though, I still didn't step all the way in...lol. \n\nWe had onion strings for the appetizer. AMAZING!! There were a few people that ordered the pizzas. I would say this is probably the best value, dollar for dollar. I had the Pork Milanese. Often times I will go for the less traditional item on the menu. It was an interesting combination to say the least. A white marbled pork loin, that is pounded down, breaded and fried, then served with an array of fresh veggies and even more onion strings.

I could also see some of the surrounding corridors being a wonderful place for a generic drunken photo shoot.. (or maybe this has already happened.. I'll never tell).\n\nOK enough about the bathrooms, but they are just THAT cool.\n\nI like this place even more than I did before.

A deliciously seasoned portabella mushroom sandwich and a Hanny's salad (served at an enormous portion) are my favorites.  The sandwiches come with onion crispies which is kind of a guilty pleasure.\n\nAn elevator as well as stairs lead up to the upstairs loft.  An old elevator shaft next to the functioning elevator (the building was build some time in the 1940s I believe) has been cleared out and glass installed so you can get quite an endless view which adds even more character and enjoyment to the place.\n\nThere is a second bar upstairs and more dining space.

You might not even notice that there are doors all around you, but the waitstaff has told you to \"push\" on one of the walls.

A clean contemporary lounge with stainless steel and concrete mixed in with black leather that extrudes and odor reminiscent of its old department store days.

This will be my fifth of the night, a Brazilian caipirinha, Sara orders a dry Chianti and a bar plate, prosciutto with fresh Parmesan and melon; Ironic since she is a vegetarian. The music is a good mix of high energy, house and electronica with a little pop.  The DJ was spinning and watching over the bar through an opening above the door like a war prisoner in his inaccessible cage. The bartender throws me a bone about the downstairs lounge that is open and draws a crowd for late night activities. Walking to the bathrooms upstairs was an adventure. On the way to the stairs is an opening with a glass floor that is about twenty feet above glass; that reflects the glass twenty feet above my head and everything between. I'm drinking a very difficult drink to perfect, the mojito. With the caipirinha falling ever so slight on its mark in sugar department, I am giving the bartender another opportunity. And it's right on the money with the mojito.

Delicious.\n\nThe pizzas at Hanny's are great.  Paper thin crusts and fresh toppings make for good eating.  I can eat a whole pizza myself and still walk out the front door.\n\nThe DJ is always spinning the coolest house..\n\nTake your time at Hanny's, enjoy the great cocktails and good food.

Otherwise, we loved it! Went here for drinks after dinner on my birthday on a Saturday night. The place is totally cool and had plenty of room for our group (20 people) to hang out and drink without disturbing the diners. \n\nWe all got a huge kick out of the renovated elevator shaft and the cool unisex bathrooms. I won't go into detail because most of the other reviews pretty much have it covered. Make sure to check out the DJ located in a little space up above everyone else. The bar is the middle of the place was perfect for the open feel of Hanny's. there was lots of space and various seating options. We settled on the large couches in the front window. There is also space upstairs for eating and drinking if you prefer a more private experience. The service was lacking so I suggest you go to the bar over using a server for cocktails (a friend waited 30 minutes for an Appletini with no apologies when it finally arrived.) \n\nThe crowd was a mixed bag of people but everyone was pretty nice. This place is cool and hip without being pretentious. We will be going back next time we are in the area!\n\nWe did not eat anything but from what I saw, it looked good.

It is definitely the place to go if you want to enjoy a classy drink in a supper club atmosphere.\n\nI have yet to move past the drink menu, so that is just about all I can criticize. The caipirinha is pretty well balanced, although I could have done without the rock candy swizzle stick (I know that a sugar cane garnish may be tough to come by in Phoenix, so we don't mind if you leave it out). They use Cacha\u00e7a 51 which isn't my favorite, but it is passable.\n\nThe sidecar was strong. Not in a good way. I enjoy sidecars because they incorporate a lot of different sweet flavors, but this just made me feel like a lush drinking a citrus-flavored martini.\n\nSpeaking of martinis, the gin martini was decent, although tiny (but a good buy for $5).\n\nThe staff is friendly and flirty -- in fact, my friend slipped the waiter my phone number after we noticed him admiring my shoes.

If only i could give it a higher rating, based solely on that, but alas this review is about the food. We arrived about 10pm on a friday, so i was thrilled that the full menu was still available; as the entire downtown PHX had almost closed down completely. We sat at the sleek bar, only to be served by a gentleman wearing a filthy butchers apron, it was so unappealing, but i thought if others stayed regardless, then the food must be off the hook!\n\nThe music definitely moved me, and i think its what was keeping the people there, lucky for the kitchen.\n\nWrong, It was anything but. The pizza margarita tasted as though it were made with cheddar, exactly like a mexican cheese crisp. Not good at all! Turns out they make it with a mixture of 3 italian cheeses mozzarella, provolone and asiago. In my opinion provolone should always be served with a meat or mushrooms, because its bold flavor is too over powering to be served with light flavors. \n\nThe pork sandwich was soo dry, it was served on hard bread too. I had one bite and left it for brian. I won't be trying that one again. \n\nThe best part of my meal was only $4+ and it was the side salad=super big. They added hearts of palms too! I couldn't believe the serving size. Too bad their balsamic dressing is straight balsamic, It would have been okay had they brought out olive oil too. They served me a gobblet of straight balsamic dressing for the salad. \n\nI think they are trying very hard to be cool, but they exert little effort. They do half the job great, then they slack off, so its kinda like being in Willy Wonka's half room. You fall in love with one part, then quickly realize it lacks big time.\n\nThe decor is nice, but not enough to make up for the weird uniforms of dirty white butcher shirts or the proscuitto sitting out in the open air; with flys dancing around, sitting on your meat and having a feast until they slice off your piece. Not my cup 'o tea thank you very much. \n\nMaybe my next try will be better, because I will give it another 2 times, as it takes 3 times to know what they trully have to offer.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6imLt53br7SJ3av07jjH7w"}

I expected more from the same guy who brought us the venerable AZ88.\n\nWhat I liked:\n\n$5 martinis and a robust wine list made for a nice pre-game watering hole for non-beer drinkers like myself.  The glasses are smaller than those at AZ88, but just as filled to the brim and at less than half the price.\n\nThe food was OK.  I ordered the chopped salad, but was surprised to discover that it wasn't really \"chopped.\" Large chunks of red-leaf lettuce accompanied by cherry tomatoes, chopped onions, and a few other ingredients.  It could have been larger and more complex.\n\nThe prices are fantastic. Brad ordered the roast beef sandwich for around $9, which came on fresh focaccia bread and was stacked with bacon and a fried egg.  He said that it was OK, but could have benefited by some more flavor -- perhaps a nice sauce.  My chopped salad was around $8, so also a healthy bargain.\n\nWhat I did not like:\n\nThe service.  Our server admitted to forgetting to place our appetizer order (the bruschetta), so our entrees arrived first.  When she realized her mistake, she apologized and said that the bruschetta will \"be right out.\" However, she still charged us for it.  Not good.\n\nThe atmosphere.  Sterile and cold, with a monochromatic color scheme and too many clean lines.  It reminded me of a hotel bar in Manhattan, with minimalist intentions taken to the extreme.  There was nothing warm or inviting about Hanny's, and it's not the type of place I would have stopped in had I been simply walking through the neighborhood.  \n\nAll in all a nice option for a pre-game drink or snack, but not the type of place I'd make my destination on a Saturday night.

It reminded me of a bath house.  I rushed back down with a look of panic on my face.  I thought it was a a restaurant that catered to \"Swingers.\" We scanned the room and it was mostly couples.  We were almost convinced of it.\n\nWe started send out a barrage of text messages to find out the real truth about this place.  Only 2 people knew about Hanny's.  Luckily, they reassured us that it wasn't a hangout for swinging couples. LOL!!\n\nAnyway, Hanny's is one of our favs in Phoenix and we are happy to have stumble upon it.

Luckily there were a couple seats at the bar so we settled in there.\n\nWe ordered two pizzas - one with pepperoni and onion and one with prosciutto (my addition lately) and apple, sans tomato sauce.

The place is pretty swanky, so make sure you're dressed appropriately. We got a round table near the back and took a look at the menu. For a place that looks so awesome, the menu isn't as hard on the wallet as one might think. Most of us started off with cocktails, I had the Huckleberry lemonade ($9, and I actually had 2) which was delish. My other friends had the peach porch tea, the pomegranate julep (SO STRONG), and a Riesling. We were all starving when we got there so we got the bruschetta appertizers which is straight up bruschetta, there was no messing around with that.  \n\nTime to order: I had the carne pizza, and everyone else had the carne with red peppers, the prosciutto de parma (sp?), the standard blt, and the roast beef sandwich. Now, when I go to a swanky looking place and pay $9 for my drink, I assume that my $13 pizza isn't going to be anything to write home about, but first of all it was massive. The leftovers were enough for at least one meal. And even the salads and sandwiches that were going by our table were pretty big. The pizza was really good, not like anything I've had before, but really yummy. We swapped samples of everyone's stuff and everything was really good.\n\nOur server was a tad slow, which we probably only noticed because we were in a crunch at the end to pay and make it to the theater in time, but he was really nice and split our checks at the end of the meal.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6imLt53br7SJ3av07jjH7w"}

Another added bonus is the DJ perched above, looking down, perhaps in scorn, at the frolicking below, as he or she spins some very loungey tunes...last time I was there the tunes included some Parliament and old school funk, right on brother...is that Bootsy in the corner? Overall the bar, bar tables, and table tables, seem just right, about the only decor issue is the odd tongue-like couches, but I'm down. \n\nThe drink list is thorough and interesting in that it features Absinthe, St.- Germain, and Chartreuse cocktails. Unfortunately, the cocktails are not consistent in quality. I'd say 70% of the time, the drinks are right on...other times, not so much. Inconsistency is ultimately what keeps Hanny's from 4 star territory. \n\nOn that theme, the food is equally, actually even more so, inconsistent. Nothing on the menu is great, at its best, things are good...such as the pizzas and salads. While it is very cool that they have a massive meat slicer at the bar, it doesn't mean the snack plate and bar plate are great. The pizza ranges from good, to somewhat flavorless. \n\nService is also inconsistent. A few times I have had great service that was timely and always around when you need a refill. But too many times I have had to actually flag someone down. Really, I am not that impatient, so when I flag someone down, we've rolled through a few tracks of funk without service. I've had better luck sitting at the bar...plus, at the bar you have a front row seat to the meat slicing. \n\nOverall, a good spot for a post-work, pre-dinner, or post-dinner drink...and maybe Bootsy and George will stop in...it could happen.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6imLt53br7SJ3av07jjH7w"}

When I was sitting in lounge, I felt as thought I was thrown back to the 80's, but in a good way. I was also very much reminded of the mind bending architecture of AZ88 with the upper story DJ booth and crazy bathrooms upstairs (a must visit spot if you dine here). \n\nThe menu offers something for everybody. Pizza, sandwiches, salads and fancy appetizer plates. Even the pickiest eater could find something to eat there. The prices are also very reasonable--I've been to far less chic and attractive places and been blown away by the sky high prices (hem hem, FnB). The full bar also boasts a unique martini menus (like AZ88), and wine is available by the carafe (LOVE that).\n\nI had the veggie pizza, which was a huge thin crust (definitely sharable for 2) and very generously topped with veggies. I washed it down with a carafe of the Malbec-Syrah blend, which I'd recommend to red wine lovers who prefer sweeter wines. I also recommend the donuts for dessert, which I read as a tip on Foursquare. The mini donuts look and taste nothing like real donuts--they're basically fried pieces of fluffy-textured dough covered in cinnamon and sugar.

On another occasion, the same bartender was rude and impatient when we came in shortly after 1am for some drinks. Yeah, I know they close at 1:30, but its just a couple drinks. Sorry to inconvenience you by making you do your job dude. \nThe rest of the bar staff, however, has always been very attentive and friendly. \nThe waitstaff is kinda meh. What a motley looking group of servers.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6imLt53br7SJ3av07jjH7w"}

They are like little clean airplane lavatories! There are some tall mirrors and seating upstairs that remind me of a fun-house. I've never seen anyone actually up here, though. Maybe we just don't hit it at \"happening times\". The action seems to be more downstairs. Huge bar in the middle. Tons of room, and quite professional and friendly service. \n\nThe food is really good. They have a variety and Veg options available. I like the pizzas (2 people can share one if you have a moderate appetite) Drinks are good, too. It's all a slight bit overpriced, but I'm okay with that as they do serve up quality. \n\nPrime location, diverse crowd and really like nothing else in the valley.

The meringue itself was sharply tart, with the sweetness serving to ensure the tartness wasn't harsh and nothing more. This is perfect! Too many places have prima donna sugar that tries to overpower the lemon. We tried it with a traditional crust (which I preferred due to it preserving the tartness and lemoniness of the meringue) and a graham crust (which my friend preferred for being easier to eat [the graham crumbles] as well as buffering the tart notes of the meringue).\n\nA star is missing for the ambiance - wait staff were very friendly, but the venue was empty.

The decor is proper and fashionable.  The aura is [very] modern delicatessen, gone bar.  For these things, I am appreciative.  The food is tasty and well delivered.  The drinks are where the points get docked.\n\nAs expected, one should have known better than to order a WWII cocktail.  I actually ordered it, and then when he asked \"what is that\", I told him I changed my mind.  Refusal to deliver a different (see: more common) drink, I accepted his offer in attempting to make it.  I spelled out the details: dash or two of Angostura, gin and a chilled cocktail glass.  No ice.  Why is he shaking this?  Why is it in a Collins glass?  Weird.  My pink gin was actually an orange gin - oh well.  Better luck next time.\n\nI've since switched to a martini.  \n\n-- \"A martini, please.\"\n- \"What kind of vodka?\"\n--\"What?  A *martini*.\"\n-\"Yea, what kind of vodka...?\"\n*head shakes*\n\nNo vermouth, so...straight gin?  Okay.  Whatever.  I'll let it slide.\n\nA friend orders me a pink gin and gives the directions of how to make it.  This is unbeknownst to me, as I am conversing with another patron.  I move back to our table to find an orange colored drink, on the rocks, in an old fashioned glass.  \n\n---\"So, I don't think this is how you make a pink gin either.\"\n\nAdditionally, said friend asks \"you have Aviation gin, right?\".  \"I don't know\", the employee responds.  He explains that it is a rhetorical question, as he saw the bottle.  He asks for a gin & tonic made with Aviation gin.  A few minutes later he is delivered a neon green glass of what seems to be nuclear waste.  Come to find out: Hanny's has a drink called \"the Aviation\" or \"the Aviator\", and that employee simply ignored the whole conversation about Aviation gin, et al.\n\nThe music here can be excellent or awful.  DJ's in training should be limited to their deck time.\n\n+2 for the food.  +0 for the drinks & delivery.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6imLt53br7SJ3av07jjH7w"}

I've visited a couple of times for cocktails and then more recently for food. The atmosphere, cocktails and overall lay-out is cool, but the food is just A-ok as is the service. \n\nThe service was pretty slow-moving and we soon learned that this is probably not the best spot to stop by if you're on a time limit. The food itself is decent, but the selections to choose from on the menu are pretty random. I couldn't quite pin point the type of cuisine this restaurant would be categorized as, but it's a hefty selection of Mediterranean eats such as prosciutto, cheeses, paninis and pizzas. The pizzas are only around $11 and they are easily able to be shared. The salads are also pretty large in size and could easily be shared as well. \n\nIn summary, this is a good spot to have a couple after-work cocktails and maybe stay for an appetizer or two, but I'll probably keep Hanny's at just that for me and choose another location for my meal, especially if I have to be somewhere! \n\n*** If you visit be sure to visit the bathrooms on the second floor.

But that's pretty cool too.\n\nOne star deduction only because if I worked at place with a drink menu this freaking awesome, it would be all I'd ever want to talk about. In fact, I don't even WORK there and I still find ways to bring up Hanny's drink menu in regular conversation. But try to engage your bartender and two times out of three (I say this because there were three bartenders when we went and I tried to talk to all of them and only of them humored me), you'll get the cold shoulder. That's right, you will get #2 of the top ten ways to say no to drugs, circa  the D.A.R.E. program, 1994. \n\nAnyway, I've been here a few times and have always had fun, mostly because I am all about the Pimm's Cup so if it's anywhere on a menu, I'm probably having a good time. I told my boyfriend that Hanny's was special because they actually served real Pimm's Cups and most places can't. He didn't believe me and responded that he's sure Ocean Club could serve a Pimm's Cup. I responded that I have already tried (I haven't) and they couldn't (I wouldn't know, I haven't tried). Just so you all know how I roll when it comes to challenging my unchecked facts.\n\nI also had some Absynthe (this is what I wanted to ask the bartenders about when I got THE COLD SHOULDER). It was okay. It tasted like Sambuca but was a lovely shade of green. I don't think the kind they sell here in the U.S. have hallucinogenic properties but it was about my 6th drink of the evening so I obviously had a good time with it.\n\nI haven't had the food but I will definitely be back for some more Pimm's Cups.

The upper floor has a small bar(that I've never seen in use) a  few more intimate spaces to hang, a VERY confusing bathroom area (due to the mirrors and lighting-you're doomed if there's an emergency) and a balcony that opens to the floor below where the classy bar is smack dab in the middle. There is a dinning area surrounding two sides as well as some tables and high chairs on the other side. \nThere is a DJ perch opposite the balcony where pretty cool, chill tunes add to the loungey feel of this place. They have a good selection of beer and wine and according to my girl, \"The BEST Manhattan EVER!!!\" (served by Rene who had awesome glasses)\nWhat I really like about this place is that it's a great place to get a little dressed up and have some high quality adult beverages.

I mean it was a Friday night and not only did me and Dottsy Z score a great parking spot, but we also scored great seats at the bar. The drinks we had were pretty strong, small but strong but the bartenders are NOT the friendliest of the bunch. I get the fact that you are busy but  you can pretend to actually like the customers you are serving. One of the bartenders got upset because a patron was saving a seat next to her for her friend who was trying to find a parking spot. He said to her that since it was soooo busy she could not save the seat (since there was this massive line of people waiting for said seat-- said sarcastically of course) We were a little put off but whateve. Or when the group that was celebrating a friends birthday and the birthday girl asked for suggestions as to what would be a good drink, he told her to read the menu to see the ingredients in the drinks and go from there. Ouch! However It didn't stop us from having a good time, it just made this review even more interesting.  All in all, great people watching, small,expensive but strong drinks, and not so friendly bartenders.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6imLt53br7SJ3av07jjH7w"}

The kitchen stays open til 1am every night and the dining area offers ample seating, even after the Suns game ends and swarms of people flood the streets and bars!  \n\nIf you live downtown, this spot should be a regular hangout!

We walked by and peeked inside. Everyone was dressed nice. We decided to go in anyway and see if I could get some food to go. A manager spotted us and said hi. I thought he was going to kick us out for looking like scrubs, but instead he escorted us to some tables. He seated us at a table with a little \"occupied\" sign and took the sign away. Sweet concept. I felt like a VIP even though I was in sweats at a posh lounge. It was as if, the lounge was whispering to me \"we were expecting you, Mr. Elite Yelper\". \n\nWe ended up ordering the roast beef sandwich and a prosciutto/apple pizza. Both entrees were freakin' awesome. The sandwich had tender slices of roast beef, thick slices of smoked bacon, and a fried egg, blanketed in a soft ciabatta roll. It had a side of onion strings and some sort of phenomenal slaw. The pizza was fantastic as well. It was a white pizza, with Fontina cheese, thin slices of prosciutto, and apples. Odd combination, but it worked really well together. \n\nThe thing I like about this place is the character. The building use to be an old department store, but they managed to convert it to a lounge. The crowd here is very trendy/hipster. They had a DJ spinning some techno/hip-hop and some really trippy (but classy) d\u00e9cor. I like the gutted elevator shaft and the high ceilings. What kind of grossed me out is the fitting room, converted bathrooms. They're uni-sexed, but pretty disgusting. Just think about what it's like to take a dump in a fitting room with no ventilation. Yup, it's exactly what you are probably imagining. \n\nOverall, I really liked this place. The kitchen is open pretty late, the food is excellent, there's no cover, and the food/drink prices are reasonable. The wife and I dropped about 50 bucks post tip/tax on roast beef sandwich, pizza, and two cocktails. This a great place to to start your night, but I would recommend using the restrooms at your next stop. I would definitely come back again. \n\nA little about my credentials:\nI first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of pastas and dishes. I never became a professional chef, but 9 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I continue to enjoy & love food.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6imLt53br7SJ3av07jjH7w"}

Other's had the rocket salad (which seemed to involve a large amount of arugula, though my friend seemed to enjoy it, and another had the chopped salad). I myself had a small side salad and the lemon vinaigrette was wonderfully subtle and fresh and I distinctly remembered commenting on how much I enjoyed it.\n\nSo there I was, exhausted after a tough week of office political infighting, and as I ate my delicious sandwich, laughed and joked with my peers, had my ice tea regularly and quietly filled up, all while hearing the ebullient  strains of classical music underscoring my experience, I felt the despair drain out of me and my willingness to go back next week into the office fray blossom once again. \n\nOkay, so four stars...obviously I loved it so why not five? Well, I don't feel that I've truly experienced a place like this one until I've had the happy hour/dinner experience and I have a feeling that this is when a place like this really shines, when the sun has not only been down but down for a loooooooong time, especially since they serve food till 1 am and last pour is at 1:30...so you have time to finish the drink and still make the last light rail.  In fact, having dinner with some other friends tonight and will put that on our future itinerary. Until then, happy eating my fellow yelpers. :-)", "type": "review", "business_id": "6imLt53br7SJ3av07jjH7w"}

The pizza for $10 was really quite good, I had the proscuitto di parma, and the beer I had from Colorado was an excellent IPA.  The side salad was also really pretty generous.  The wine list, it's terrible.  I know about wine, so I know what I'm talking about.  The 'reserve' list?  It had a $9 Pinot Gris from Washington for $37 dollars.  Stop the madness.

I have to be more descriptive in reviews? Fine.\n\nThis place rocks. Shut up and sit down at the bar. Order anything. You'll learn pretty fast. You can't go wrong with the Caiprinaha. I can't pronounce (or spell) it either, but they'll be more than happy to give you an intro to this high-octane Brazilian cocktail. Yes, it's $10 but you don't even know what cachaca is so pipe down and enjoy it. If you're a wuss like me, just stir it up with your nifty stick of rock candy until you can handle it. All cocktails are pricey, but most of them use high-end ingredients. All made by knowledgeable bartenders.\n\nIf you want dinner, just go with something that has prosciutto on it. I had it on my pizza and lemme tell you--you can't go wrong with this. If you dine at the right time, you can expect a DJ on the second floor.\n\nBut whatever you do, use the restrooms. USE THE RESTROOMS. Tell me you're not amused. I'll try not to ruin the surprise.\n\nOverall, I've only been here a handful of times, but I don't think I could ever get tired of it. Here are some tiny nit-picky criticisms I have:\n\n-It was totally cooler when the bathrooms didn't have labels on them. I think there were more mirrors (oops! spoiler alert!) too. I totally understand why it would need the slight adjustment, and it's still great for conversation.\n\n-Several cocktails stood out because they used Bacardi Rum. At the risk of sounding like a snob, that discouraged me from trying the rum-based beverages.\n\n-Your staff looks a tad worn out and a bit short. When I get carded twice to order a drink, I can tell that a lack of communication may spill into other tasks around the establishment. \n\n-WHEN IS THE BAR ON THE SECOND FLOOR OPEN!?

Definitely has an Italian flair if you know the first thing about pizza (think Neapolitan style, but a tad more thin.) Even their prosciutto was above-par.\n\nAmbiance was definitely unique.

It had arugula, goat cheese, pistachios and a really nice light flavored dressing.  The pistachios were a very nice touch.  Very good.  I have also had their bar plate appetizer.

Very swanky modern place with a fun and eclectic atmosphere and a great variety of drinks. \n\nOur group had a $60 tab, which we paid, then moved on to another place. The next day I found out that our $60 tab got charged, as well as a second charge for $219! I called my bank and disputed the charges (which could take 10 days) and they recommended working with management at Hanny's to cancel the charges, so the funds could be returned within the hour. I found out that our server accidentally charged our card for the wrong tab, voided the transaction, and then said nothing to us (probably hoping the money would be returned to our account before we noticed). \n\nWhen I called, the manager seemed nonchalant about the whole thing, never once apologized for what happened, and then said I shouldn't worry about it because they didn't actually charge my card and it would probably drop off on its own faster than he could contact his merchant services about it the following day. I still asked him to follow up, told him I'd appreciate his time, and reminded him we were talking about $220 here. He begrudgingly said he would and then didn't get back to me today. When I called, he obviously hadn't passed along the information to the other manager because he had zero knowledge of what had happened and the funds are still on hold 3 days later. \n\nHappy birthday, right?!

But I also love weekends for killing St. Germain martini after martini, rapping to the old school hip hop playing from the DJ booth, occasionally ordering a Proscuitto di Parma pizza to soak up the alcohol from the spots I hit before I made it to Hanny's (I'm talking to you Candlestick Makers at The Arrogant Butcher).  And I second Bryan B's comment about the staff - they definitely remember regulars and make sure to go out of their way to keep you happy.\n\nI think, as an east coast birdie, a good deal of my love of Hanny's is the fact that I feel like I'm back in NYC or DC for a night, all without leaving the valley.  The starkly modern decor that embraces the bones of the old department store that Hanny's calls home is preserved so elegantly well.  And I still giggle as I snap pictures in the abandoned elevator shaft.  The bathrooms aren't gimmicky in my opinion (I love the ecstatic silhouette of the people in wheelchairs!) but you may have to walk past people that don't understand that you need to just push on doors to see which ones are vacant.

And you cannot beat a 5 dollah martini! Your choice gin or vodka. Or a petite for you lightweights at 2.50. \n\nI do vaguely recal having the delicious BLT or at least a bite of one the last time I was here late night after a show at Crescent. LATE NIGHT! During the week none the less. I love that Downtown is starting to have some life again! Woohoo!", "type": "review", "business_id": "6imLt53br7SJ3av07jjH7w"}

Having heard great reviews about the place, it's food and the vibe... I had to try it.\n\nRestored into a restaurant and bar from an old department store, Hanny's has the feel straight of of New York City. The lighting is dim enough to give that sexy, intimate feelings and with long, pew style seating with individual tables, the vibe is very posh.\n\nMy roommate and I ordered the bruscetta plate and the margarita pizza. Very good choice! The bruscetta plate was on the saltier side, so be wary of that but it was delish. The pizza was much bigger than we expected. For $10 you really do get a good deal. \n\nWe each orded drinks. A orded the peach martini and a glass of giseling. Wasn't a HUGE fan of the martini and I thought it tasted like cough syrup but it was also my very first martini so I am not holding Hannys against anything. My roommate on the other hand said it was the best Manhattan he'd ever had, which I believe.\n\nHannys has a modern feel with a touch of Mad Men and I simply cannot wait to go back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6imLt53br7SJ3av07jjH7w"}

I have never met such an overly arrogant and prideful staff. They feel that as long as you have a minor issue, it is your fault and not theirs. For example, my friend specifically asked for the midnight martinis, it is 12:02 PM. She serves us full sized martinis. My friend was a little concerned that the waitress didn't hear us correctly, and to make sure we were not being charged full priced, she flagged the waitress over to which she says \"those are full priced martinis.\" My friend proceeds to state that we have specifically requested midnight martinis to which the waitress responds \"I didn't hear you.\". So instead of apologizing for the misunderstanding and offering the midnight specials, she retaliates and gets defensive. Because of her incompetence, we request to speak to the manager to which he towers over the table and asks \"What's going on here?\". oh hi, nice to see you too. He didn't even introduce himself properly nor professionally. I was so turned off by the negative and defensive attitude, that I have just about had it with that place. IT is not the first time I have received this poor service, and they need to get off their high horse and get their game together. Sorry i'm not sorry Hanny's, but we're going to have to part ways.\n\nWhat is a huge turn off of all, is knowing that after scrolling through these reviews, 1 out 5 customers are very unhappy with the service provided and almost all have the same context, \"servers and waitstaff are rude\". \n\nI am pleading out to the owner of Hanny's: For the sake of you're great restaurant, please hire new management and waitstaff, they are making you look horrible!!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "6imLt53br7SJ3av07jjH7w"}

It reminded me of one of the speak-easy style restaurant/bars in LA, with a great menu and drink selection to boot.  If I lived in AZ, this would surely be a hang out.\n\nI had a beet salad, veggie pizza, and a Pim's cup, and really enjoyed the food (as did my family, who also had pizzas and dessert).  This place is great if you have stuff to do downtown (either before or after a show/event), and the swanky/sexy atmosphere would be great for a date as well.  I loved that they kept the vibe of the former store alive, but added their own flare, including the bathrooms & downstairs (it is a must to see both).\n\nOur server Nicole did an awesome job!  She was really nice and on top of it, and made the evening even more special.  The bar was packed and for good reason - the bartenders really know how to make a drink!  (They are all pretty easy on the eyes, too...).  A DJ was spinning from his perch above the crowd, adding to the overall cool ambiance.\n\nI recommend parking in a lot nearby as it can be a bit hard to find a spot on a busy night.  But, there's a lot to walk to nearby, so you get a lot of bang for your buck.  A huge plus - the kitchen is open until 1am 7 days a week!\n\nPhoenix needs more places like Hanny's!

I thought for sure I had reviewed this place. Whoops. Ok, I really love Hanny's. Like for real, it's almost creepy. You instantly feel cool as fuck upon walking into this bar. A huge part of that is the AWESOME FUCKING MUSIC playing on Friday's and Saturday's, but the other part is the lighting and interesting layout of the place. It's very unique and almost secretive. There's a weird basement downstairs that you can't get into, then upstairs is where the DJ spins incredible electronic music. There's another upstairs section with a separate bar and dining area, nice little spot to chill. You can overlook the restaurant, make sexual eye contact with the DJ, and flick water onto unsuspecting patrons. What! I have never done that. The bathrooms are kinda weird, at first I struggled on where I was supposed to go and how to open the door. It's even more difficult when you're hammered, but usually there's someone else up there wandering around wondering the same thing. Together, you'll probably figure it out. The drinks are very unique and strong. A good variety to choose from. A tad bit pricey, but it goes with the style of the bar. The food is great too. I've had their sandwiches, salads and pizzas. All were just delicious! I get very excited every time the suggestion of going to Hanny's come up during the weekend. I highly recommend this spot. :)\n\n*Side note - only reason for 4 stars instead of the 5 - sometimes the staff can be a little snotty. At least 3 separate times I've had both bartenders and servers act kind of rude. Not anything terrible, especially for a person like me who isn't bothered by much, but just a tinge of an attitude.

Alas, I have not. \n\nI've been here several times since last year. I love the design of this department store turned restaurant. And the basement! The creepy dolls are so awesome. Once I got behind the gate and got a picture with the dolls... totally got caught trespassing but oh well. Worth it. The vibe is very hip and trendy, definitely a great place to impress a date. \n\nOnto the food-I don't really eat meat so my options are limited. Every time I actually eat there though, I'm all over the Cauliflower Calabrese. It's on the appetizer menu, but I always order it as my entree. It's a spicy veggie mix of cauliflower, peppers and onion strings. So. Damn. Delicious. I've had the bruschetta, and it totally wasn't what I expected it to be since it's more of a tampenade with bread. I also had a veggie sandwich there once that was pretty tasty, I'd still pick the cauliflower dish over it any day though. I look forward to the day where more veggie or fish options are available, take note Hanny's!\n\nDrink-wise, I usually order the Moscow Mule. Do NOT order it from the upstairs bar, they don't serve it in the copper mugs and trust that it is not the same. I also like ordering Jameson with a splash of ginger ale. The bartenders know what they're doing and make stiff drinks (at least in my experience). \n\nAs far as service is concerned, it's alright. I wouldn't say it's the greatest. I'm pretty patient though because when I go, it's normally super packed.

The appetizers were an appropriate serving size (we ordered the bar plate and the asparagus with egg), and my husband's pork milanese was fantastic- breaded and cooked perfectly.

He looked around at our clean table as if he didn't believe us! I had to explain that we had already cleaned it up and the food runner took away the garbage in his absence. He said he would talk to a manager and walked away. Although I was offended by his insinuation, I almost felt bad for him.

The doors have no outside handles so I walked past them initially as with the mirrors and the dancing figures painted on the doors it felt more like a dance studio then a bathroom.

The place looks a bit like a converted theater with a DJ on the 2nd level where you can see him through an opening in the wall.  There is some cool art around the restaurant too. There is also an old shaft-looking corner with a glass floor that looks quite cool.  I loved the modern yet low-key relaxed vibe that attracts a diverse crowd.  The food and drinks did not disappoint.  I only had a veggie pizza with a glass of wine but both were delicious.  I definitely would like to come back to enjoy more Hanny's.

I asked the server if the bass could be turned down - something I've NEVER done at a restaurant before.  The answer we received:  \"I'm pretty sure they won't turn it down and I'm not even sure they can\".  Hmmm ....

It's right across from US Airways center, making it a great place to go either before or after you catch a game/show (aka get your drinks cheaper!) They are know for their $5 martini. Yeah, it's $5 and it DOESN'T SUCK!! I got it clean, because some places, getting it dirty is just disgusting. It was ice cold, went down smooth, and did the job well. \n\nI've also tried a few of their champagne cocktails, because I am a classy broad. The French 75 is very delicious and for a few $$ more, the Celebration is tre chic. Their Old Fashioned is pretty damn good too and strong. I think I will slowly work my way through their other cocktails, starting with their Moscow Mule (yes, they come with the copper cup).\n\nFood wise, I usually go with a small snack platter to balance out my cocktail intake. It's good for 2 people max and comes with a variety of salty meats, cheeses, olives, and nuts. I've also had the milanesa which was really good and big enough to share! Some day when I am feeling extra fancy (aka make a date take me here), I'll try some real entrees. \n\nDress code wise, it's all over the map. You'll see people dressed up like they've come from the opera, others like they rolled out bed, and some like they are waiting for their pimp. It's a scene, that's for sure. As for ambiance, the restrooms are trippy. There's no guys/girls, it's a big cluster *bleep* and you kind of feel like you're in a fun house. Also, check out the old elevator shaft. And also, ask to go downstairs.

This place is classy, but without being intimidating or overly pricey. I like to think about it as a local version of the chain restaurant Joeys (but without being pretentious). \n\nMy husband and I ordered the cauliflower and a pizza (half bianco, half prosciutto). The food was so tasty! It tasted very fresh and full of flavor. We even had to order desert. Our server let us know that they make everything in house except for the Chocolate Crisp Cake. We had the Tiramisu, which was to die for. \n\nTip: The pizza is VERY thin.. more like flat bread, but it was still amazing. Our server said that one person can eat a whole pizza if it doesn't have meat on it. So plan accordingly. \n\nThe ambiance of the place is very cool. Our server let us know that the restaurant used to be a department store, and then after it was abandoned it was used by the local fire department as a test building. It was pretty cool to walk around the restaurant and see the history. Make sure you check out the bathrooms on the second floor and the basement for a surprise art exhibit! (Our server wouldn't tell us what it was.. so just check it out for yourselves like we did. :p ) \n\nOne thing that Hanny's is lacking is draft beer as well as soda on tap. I haven't been to many restaurants that don't have this, and as a fan of draft beer, I was a little disappointed. I understand that Hanny's bar focus is their cocktails though. Also they do not have a happy hour (but they do have their $5 martinis which they seem to be famous for).", "type": "review", "business_id": "6imLt53br7SJ3av07jjH7w"}

I have always enjoyed what I have ordered almost always seem to order the same things. This time, however, not so much. Actually, based on this visit, I am not sure we will drive across town just to have dinner here. \n\nI have always enjoyed the look of Hanny's, I think it's really well done and I enjoy the vibe and energy. I don't think the service has ever stood out to me, and this time - yeah, definitely not. We had to wait awhile for a host to seat us, a busser bumped into me carrying a tub of glassware and didn't even pardon himself, and our server was alright but the service was rather basic and impersonal.\n\nDrinks - I always order an Old Fashioned here (my favorite cocktail) and I remembered they were good. I don't know if they changed them or the bartender rushed and didn't taste his creation - but that was awful. I am not one to typically send a drink back unless it is completely disgusting - it wasn't, just not that enjoyable. It tasted like bitter whiskey soda. Too much bitters, not enough syrup, and I would recommend they use Amarena cherries like most other bars are doing now, not cheap Maraschinos that they muddled in my glass with the stems on. Cmon! My boyfriend ordered the Huckleberry Lemonade - what a sugar rush! I don't know how people can drink that, but hey, to each their own. It tasted like something a 21-year old would order at Applebee's. I would think Hanny's would update to keep up with the trendy places around town, get some craft-cocktails, etc. \n\nFood - I always order the Asparagus & Egg - ehh - the asparagus was overcooked and yellowish. Disappointed. This is something I recommended we order for my boyfriend to try for the first time as it was my favorite starter. I also typically order the Carne pizza and the Prosciutto pizza. One thing I will say, their crust is just to my liking - mwah! I love a good thin and crispy crust. The Carne is a bit greasy - cheese, ground beef, pepperoni - but the crust saves it being crisp and a little dry to soak up the extra wetness. The Prosciutto was ok except for the arugula - it was not fresh, a bit dry and rubbery like it had sit out for awhile. \n\nAll in all, I still like Hanny's. I think the place is cool, the atmosphere is fun, the prices are good, the food is good. It is...good. Not great. I don't know if I will still refer to it as one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix anymore, but if I am ever downtown and want Pizza and a drink, I may stop in again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6imLt53br7SJ3av07jjH7w"}

I was so furious at this point but, I still kept my mouth shut.\nThe manager was a complete A-hole to say the least about how he handled this scenario.\nThroughout the night as the manager would walk by our table, I could hear him cursing out loud, very unprofessional to say the least. \nIt seemed that every time an associate reported something to him this is how he responded.\nI witnessed as patrons would walk in and out for smoke breaks (I'm a non-smoker) out the North side doors they would then re-enter in from the same side doors he would visibly get angry, upset and start cursing closing the doors as if he was an angry father trying to tell his kids to keep the doors closed because, you are letting the cold air conditioning out of the house.\nI later realized there was a sign that reads on those side doors to \"please enter from front of the restaurant, the East\" however, this gives this douche bag no rhyme or reason to conduct himself in this unprofessional, disrespectful manner. Customer are paying money to be there in this establishment, smokers or nonsmokers customers should be able to come in or out of whatever door they so choose.\nIf it wasn't for these customers his dumb ass wouldn't even be working there.\nThis was a huge buzz kill for me and I was embarrassed for him to say the least.\nIf the owner of this establishment cared enough about how his 'management staff' treated customers, I believe he would say \"get the hell outta here and don't ever come back, how dare you treat our customer this way\".\nI still chose to stay and spent well over  $800.00 on drinks and food for my party only because, I didn't want to inconvenience them and relocate, which I very easily could've done but, I wanted my friends and family to enjoy themselves.\nWill I ever bring my friends or family back there again, as long as that manger is there NEVER EVER AGAIN WILL I STEP FOOT IN THAT BUILDING NOR WILL I EVER REFER ANYONE THERE AGAIN EVER!\nIf you go there and this A-hole Manager is there Good luck!\nHe might even be entertaining for you if you like looking at angry A-Holes who curse out loud.\nAnd the bathrooms smell, that is where this so called 'manager' belongs!", "type": "review", "business_id": "6imLt53br7SJ3av07jjH7w"}

Looked at us, took our order, someone else dropped off our food then we had to get a manager to help us get our check because she disappeared.. Shen then returned a 1/2 hour later dropped off the bill and didn't say two words to us..\nJust odd...\nBut it was a cool atmosphere though. The bar looked awesome. Don't expect great service though. If great food is what you're looking for, check out Kincaids. It was great - went there twice in the 4 days I was in Phoenix.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6imLt53br7SJ3av07jjH7w"}

Service is phenomenal and the cocktail menu scores very highly on my hit list. Our party enjoyed sturdy old-fashioned cocktails with loads of bourbon, a lemonade mixer (sweet and easy) and a couple of beers. The snacks are delightful, and the in-house desserts were excellent. Not a fan of key-lime pie but Hanny's, you've won me over with your version and your tiramisu is scrumptious. Flatbreads were very decent and the prosciutto sampler - divine.

Angel's Trumpet Ale House, so named because of the meaning of their last name and their passion for all things craft beer, is my new favorite place.\n\nService: Generally speaking, opening nights are fraught with disaster, poor service, and mediocre food. Not so with AT, everything was as amazing as I would expect it to be when the place wasn't jam packed with people. Our server was pleasant, pretty speedy, and explained a few details to us. She was in a hurry, but she didn't hurry us, and that's a really good thing.  5 stars for service.\n\nFood: The FOOD! Oh yes the food was incredible. \n\nI can think of no greater sin than soggy wings, but these wings were crispy and tender, with an incredible spicy buffalo sauce, and a delicious bleu cheese dressing. Instead of throwing a few carrot and celery stalks on the plate, they were made into a salad with a few radishes for spice and color. Let me say again, the wings are AMAZING.  \n\nMy honey ordered the pizza with peppered bacon, sausage, pepperoni, and leeks - it was crispy, just enough cheese and sauce without being overwhelming, and the ingredients were amazingly high quality. I ordered the Southwest burger, and it was incredible. I love that you get to choose your protein - I chose beef, and the beef patty was moist and perfectly cooked/seasoned. My only \"complaint\" is that I wanted MORE Adobo sauce for a bigger kick, and maybe a bit more cheese, but those are easy modifications to make next time around. The burger bun was light and delicious, with perfect flavor to compliment the patty and toppings. \n\nThey also have featured seasonal dishes on the chalk wall as you walk in, and they sound absolutely incredible.\n\nDessert was fantastic and a fun play on childhood treats. We ordered the seasonal pop tart which was strawberry rhubarb, and it was delicious. The filling wasn't sickening sweet like a normal pop tart, and it was spread between layers of what looked to be a modified puff pastry or phyllo dough. The top was drizzled with a fantastic thin frosting, and finished with sprinkles of pink sugar for a playful and crunchy touch.  5 stars for food!\n\nBeer: Their beer selection on tap is magnificent. So many beers I know and love, and many that I had never tried/heard of before. I tried two new IPA's and they were both splendid. The pour was great both times - one in a pint and one in a tulip, the head was perfectly poured with just the right amount and appropriately sized bubbles. Their beer folks know their stuff. 5 stars for beer!\n\nAtmosphere: I loved walking up and into ATAH. The slump block building reminds me of my childhood home, and their metal grate dividers outside are genius and rustic. The inside perfectly blends the beauty of the wood rafters and block walls with bright colors, natural wood chairs and tables, concrete bar top, and tile backsplash. And you can't miss the massive amount of windows to let in the sun and the gorgeous sunset views. It was a true pleasure to take part in the best time of Arizona summers at this amazing pub. Oh, and I love that they have three unisex bathrooms, it is a nice relief from the standard multiple stall setup that precludes you from privacy in your most private moments.  5 stars for atmosphere\n\nSo that's 5 stars all around, and I only expect it to get better with age. I'm going back tonight, and maybe tomorrow, and definitely Sunday. I'll be here a lot., you should definitely try it.", "type": "review", "business_id": "41j3GB7M-Lwq284Pfb9zgw"}

Overall I'm pleased!\nBuilding marking signage is on the south side wall, and parking is available in the dirt lot next to that wall as well as limited parking up front.\nFurniture is simple butcherblock tables, well laid out. The beer bar has a large chalkboard above it, 31 taps and several wines. Music is there, but not loud at all. Room acoustics might use some work, it gets a little loud in there but hey what do you expect with a house full of yapping beer freaks?! \n\nGood variety of beers, offering the major breweries we already know such as Deschutes, Odell, Warsteiner (Dunkel), Epic, Sam Adams (a new style!), New Belgium, Green Flash, and more. Kegs blow all the time and something different is put on. Beers are priced $6,7,8. Snifter served for high ABV beers, PROPER TALL PINT glass for regulars and tulips for Beligian styles. No American \"pint\" glasses which actually serve 12 oz. plus head, those are for ice water. \n\n**** INSIDE SKINNY:  \nThe place has an outdoor patio out back, and now that the weather is getting cooler IT'S SUPER NICE OUT THERE for sunset and after. In fact it's really nice for a date with a candle on the table. Get one on the rear edge of the patio rather than near the door, it's quieter.\n\nSampler flights are available for a fair deal! Pick 6, write the tap numbers on the paper, and they'll be delivered in a muffin tray oriented with the paper! \n\nSo now on to the food!\nYeah get ready. \nThe menu is gourmet scrumptious, and I CANNOT WAIT to try some of those things! These dishes have flavor combinations that will blow your mind just by reading them, and the choice WILL be difficult. You'll just have to convince yourself you'll try the other dish next time.\n\nMy recommendations: \n\nThe Chet: ($8.50) - Tortilla stuffed with fries, chorizo, black beans, roasted corn,  grilled chile peppers, chihuahua cheese, adobo sauce and crema. I saw this one, nice grill marks on the tortilla. SPICY.\n\nThe 810: (sammy,$8.50) Shaved smoked turkey, peppered bacon, avocado mash, pickled red onions, adobo sauce, side of pickled jalapeno long slices. Choice of side - I recommend the fries, they're flavorful and perfectly done.\n\nMeat Treat Pizza: ($10) 10\" Flatbread pizza with peperoni, sausage, smoked bacon, LEEKS!!!, smoked mozz, roasted tomato sauce. Saw this one, the toppings just POP at you! Nice size too!\n\nWarm Sausage Platter: ($10) Wild game!! Brat! Chorizo! with mustards and relishes. This comes out and it's SPECTACULAR.\n\nHaven't had the burgers, but they look and smell scrumptious. My friend had the Southwest Burger.\n\nI guess you can see what flavors I like, haha.\nLeeks for me ANYWHERE are a pleasant surprise as well.\n\nBased on the most recent visit, I now upgrade to FIVE STARS!\nVery attentive and accurate service. My friend's iced tea was never neglected, and our large party was checked on every so often. (Gratuity added automatically for larger parties. 6 or more?)\n\nSo.... give this place a try, I think you'll be happy.\nAfter work for dinner would seem to be the best time before it gets too packed.\n\nNevermind Hungry Monk, EAT HERE.", "type": "review", "business_id": "41j3GB7M-Lwq284Pfb9zgw"}

We arrived on Saturday night, the first weekend Angels Trumpet was open, around 10 p.m. for drinks. There was a large group of us, 9 people... though there weren't any tables to accomodate our party we were able to stand/be seated comfortably around one of the high-tops.\n\nThis place is great for smaller parties who enjoy a good beer. The selection cannot be beat in downtown Phoenix -- 31 craft brews on tap of every taste and style... and they're always rotating. I had the Biere Blonde & White... 4.5% alcohol, light, sunny taste. Reminded me of Four Peak's SunBrew.\n\nThe selection ranges from hoppy IPAs at 10% alcohol/volume to the lighter, summer brews and everything in between. There is literally something for everyone, even a few wines on tap for the non-beer drinkers.\n\nOur server was very nice and accommodating.. and though the place was packed she got us our drinks pretty quickly.\n\nA couple reasons I didn't give Angels Trumpet the perfect '5' star rating:\n\nDisorganization-- Seating was sort of a nightmare... and we kind of waited around for one of the high-tops to open up and just snagged it.\nAmbience-- I enjoyed the nice, open floor plan but the restaurant-style and dozens of tables/chairs was a bit puzzling considering the kitchen was closed when we arrived. I couldn't hear any music above the conversations in the room and the huge, 60\" TV screens weren't turned on. It'd be nice for weekend nights to boast something a little more special. If you're going to close the kitchen, allow people to walk around and mingle more.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a nice place to kick back with a small group of friends and try some awesome, unique beers on tap, Angels Trumpet is it. Their prices are reasonable for the quality offered. Haven't tried the food, but the menu is pretty diverse offering a spin on traditional bar food like flatbread pizzas and sandwiches.", "type": "review", "business_id": "41j3GB7M-Lwq284Pfb9zgw"}

If we were to order, our food would arrive well over an hour of our arrival.  Naturally, this was all the information we needed enough to say \"No, we're just here for a beer or two.\"  Soon after, we were seated and placed an order for 3 pints.  We waited a good 15-20 minutes for our beers.  During that time, we noticed lots of servers standing around one POS (point of sale).  It looked as if servers were waiting in line to put in their individual orders.  Our suspicion was confirmed later that evening, only one working POS.  I wonder why they didn't have a backup plan-paper tickets?  I would think people would be more inclined to walk out on their tab because of the excruciating wait than management have to worry about losing money with paper tickets.\n\nOur waters were refilled twice before our first round of beers arrived at our table.  Two of my buddies call this place the \"Water House\" because that's all they got when they visited Angel's Trumpet Ale House.  \n\nOnce we received our beers, we asked her to place another order for another round of beers because we figured that we would receive our 2nd set of beers just as we finished our first ones.  It worked!  If ya plan on having another beer, be sure to place an order as soon as the first beers arrive so that you don't hafta wait long for your second beer.  \n\nI think the night was best portrayed by a sneak peek that I got of the owner- he was rubbing his temples and obviously under stress. \n\nI am inclined to give them a star or two more once the timing has improved.  \n\nGreat building, good ambiance, wonderful patio (hope it's pet friendly), excellent location and a good selection of beers.  \n\nOh, I like the idea of three bathroom choices instead of the typical two.", "type": "review", "business_id": "41j3GB7M-Lwq284Pfb9zgw"}

They have a huuuge chalkboard of their current beers that you are supposed to look at, but as I was sitting off to the side (and have bad eyes) it was a bit difficult to see and I had to stand awkwardly for 3 minutes in front of the chalkboard to make my decision. \n\nThe service is still...new.  The garden pizza was perfectly...fine.

Three accompanying sauces were served (Ranch?/Some sort of light cinnamon flavored/  and a Tabasco-like spicy one). Unfortunately all 3 sauces failed. Please don't try and re invent the wheel and  don't try and fancy-up wings. Would never order these again. We then split the roasted beet and arugula salad. The roasted beets were fabulous and just the right amount of crumbles. We did not particularly care for the metal plate the salad was served on, as both of us kept getting that metal on metal scrapping feeling when we dug into it. The service was friendly and prompt, our waitress was helpful, although had no idea what we were talking about when we asked about sour ales. I asked because an article had mentioned that it was a favorite of one of the owners.

I was worried when I first walked in because there were many people standing at the entrance... but we got right in and were seated (this was a little before 9 on a Friday).  \n\nI liked the energy of the place... and how excited the imbibers seemed, however I'm torn... I want to rate it a full four, but then I thought of the loudness and also the \"ok\" food.  I wasn't looking for an intimate evening with my man, but yes, I realized I was shouting after a while.  I saw the overwhelmingly large selection of craft brews on the large chalk board... and really neat looking taps.\n\nI went up to the board and figured out which ones I wanted and got a flight.  I don't drink tons of beer... but I enjoy craft brews.  I did take a peek at their wine selection and was disappointed to see no local wines.  This is a running disappointment for me... but that's for another rant.  But I made my selections and we got a taco appetizer.  The tacos were okay... but the chimichuri was REALLY good.  I found a new love... I REALLY liked the Hazelnut beer.  I'm definitely going back for that one.  I picked a few that weren't totally to my liking... but others that were.  I really like trying a few different flavors.  \n\nWe ordered the white flatbread pizza... which was a little better than okay.  I don't think it was bad, I just know that I've had better flatbreads in downtown.  Not to say I won't have another... or I won't try some other food there... I've just had better.\n\nSo  I'd probably give this a 3.5, because I want to support anything downtown.  I think there are some kinks that need to be worked out... nothing horrendous.

How long does it take to cook sweet potatoes in their kitchen?

I also had a sausage sampler with housemade chorizo, some germain sausage and wild boar sausage. All of it was awesome. it was served with housemade ketchup, a fwe mustards, grilled onions and some potatoes. I can't wait to go back and get the same plate.

We had to order by number because our server was so confused. This might get fixed with experience and training, but I would expect an \"alehouse\" to at least nail this out of the gate.\n\nThe menu has some glitches yet, which our server warned us about. It took multiple trips to the kitchen to figure out which food they had/didn't have. Kind of took the fun out of trying to pair our beers with our meals.\n\nMain building was so noisy we could barely hear anyone our table. Outside wasn't an option because it was pitch black. So if you go at night, you get to see or hear everyone else in your party, but probably not both.\n\nParking Lot is a trap. We watched seven cars in a row pull in, realize there was nowhere to go, then back out onto the street to find street parking. Surprised there was no accident.\n\nIn spite of being told no smoking on the patio, several people were smoking and none of the servers or managers seemed to care. So is smoking allowed or not? Who knows. Mildly annoying by itself, but I think an example of the bigger problem that not everyone here is on the same page yet. Your visit will likely vary widely depending on when you go and who takes care of you.\n\nI had an okay time, but have no desire to return. Giving them 3 stars because I love their idea and love to see something new downtown, and hope others try them out while they work to raise their game.", "type": "review", "business_id": "41j3GB7M-Lwq284Pfb9zgw"}

They have a small private lot but it was full when I got there at 4pm. There's plenty of street parking around, both paid and free, so you might have to walk a few yards.\nThe beer menu is a giant chalkboard on one wall. They are numbered for easy ordering and seemed a pretty varied selection. I tried the Moa Breakfast from Moa Brewing, New Zealand and a strawberry blonde from The Brewery in Pine, Arizona. Both were good and very fresh tasting. My dad tried three different IPAs and a couple samples of various beers; he liked them all. I'm do not like IPAs at all but they have plenty of hops-free selections. I was a little sad at their lack of ciders - I was hoping for find a place when at least one new cider on tap but they only had one - Woodchuck - which is good but hardly difficult to find (you can buy a 6-pack of their many varieties at most grocery stores). \nI also got the Churchill Grilled Cheese and their \"home made\" \"Pop Tarts\". The grilled cheese is mozzarella and fontina cheese, honey, house pesto, and I added bacon for an additional $1. The tarts were more akin to \"toaster strudels\" and were really good - the flavour of the day/week was grape. \n\nThe only major problem (which has been mentioned in a few reviews) are the acoustics. When we first arrived, it wasn't bad because it wasn't that busy but by 6pm, it was full and I had to just about yell across our small table to be able to talk to my dad. Not really a place for conversation. \n\n5 beers, 2 meals, and dessert all came to $70 with a nice tip. A little pricier than I like to go for a dinner but alcohol will easily add up. Nevertheless, I would definitely come back for the selection and the food. Definitely a place to try out when looking for a small, local eatery downtown.", "type": "review", "business_id": "41j3GB7M-Lwq284Pfb9zgw"}

They write the beer selection on a GIANT chalkboard behind the bar and it is ever-changing as the beers run out and new ones are tapped.

In fact, I've been waiting (with beer-baited breath) for some time now for this place to open, even following the building process on their Facebook page, because it is a great downtown destination for a quality beer after work. With FilmBar right across the street, this block is possibly morphing into one of the coolest parts of town.\n\nLet's talk about the beer. I like the rotating 31 flavors (or is it 32?). Either way, it's more fun than being a kid at Baskin-Robbins, eyeballing the beer selection as one barrel is emptied and another unusual selection takes its place. Sometimes I think it would be better if they had a standard line-up of six beers or so, as it takes some effort to pick a beer that suits your mood. There's a lot of information to absorb from the giant list including brewery, region, beer name, beer style, etc. and many of the beer styles are fairly exotic. However, it is a great beer adventure...\n\nThe food at Angel's Trumpet is some good stuff too. I had to try The Nutter after reading a review of this place in a local paper. Get this: peanut butter, bananas, raspberry-chipotle jam PLUS housemade marshmellow fluff and peppered bacon! This was a fabulous grilled sandwich experience you're not likely to encounter elsewhere. The pizzas and Asian-style wings were also pretty damn tasty, so I think they've got all the right elements any respectable alehouse should have.\n\nMy only gripe (yet not enough to give them less than five stars) was that it was not made clear that a 20% gratuity would be added to my bill automatically. We started as a group of four that grew to about eight, and the staff was incredibly accommodating. I ended up tipping 20% (on top of the already-included 20%) for my meal, which made things a little pricier than I had anticipated. I want this place to succeed, so I don't feel too bad about over-tipping, I just think they need to mention the automatic gratuity for parties over a certain size.", "type": "review", "business_id": "41j3GB7M-Lwq284Pfb9zgw"}

I was optimistic about liking this place, but now I just don't want to go there.  It fails in every important regard except pretense.\nIt tries to be semi-fancy with a Bauhaus style minimalist interior decor, carefully plated dainty portions, but the service is abysmal.  Tables are packed in as tight as they can be fit and it's very difficult to move between them.\nFriday, friends mostly got drinks from the bar and the whole evening, no one came by our table -- not even once.  Yet going to the bar is battle.  It's more like a college bar on game night.  I watched for 20 minutes as the bartenders huddled around the two restaurant computer terminals, waiting their turn and talking, running in and out, avoiding making eye contact with anyone, and occasionally turning around and randomly serving who happened to be right there.  By bad luck, I watched two sets of people surrounding the whole bar get served and didn't get served myself.  You could tell me to suck it up, but I know that in bars on corners, in sketchy music halls, dives, and nicer places, all over Phoenix, there are bartenders who know how to manage crowds with grace.  Good servers are hard to find, especially when you're apparently hiring based on looks.  They have a bunch of inexperienced kids.  While waiting at the bar for 20 minutes, I was asked approximately six times to move so that dirty dishes could be unloaded in front of me, or a server could squeeze by behind or in front of me, but at no point, despite me gesticulating and trying to make eye contact, was I offered a beer.  At no visit on any night has the wait staff been professional or competent.  I imagine ever trying to ask questions about what's on tap or what's coming in would be met with awkward confusion.  This is what I expect of  Mill Avenue on a Friday night.\nI love beer and I especially love good beer, and this establishment is on in a long string of places opening up across the valley that pretends to deal in that.  Another reviewer complained that they were confused by the beers and their hard to pronounce names, which is funny, because they've taken the step of numbering all of the taps and having people order by number.  The wait staff doesn't know the names of the beers or anything about them either.  And the beers are almost entirely non-extraordinary.  It's mostly stuff that you can get at Safeway in a bottle, year round, which admitted is better than some places with lots of taps where most of the taps are Coors, Bud, etc (that's the only star this place gets from me).  It's not that the beers are bad per se, but things like Oak Creek Brewing Company's Nutbrown and Four Peaks Brewing's Kiltlifter are $5 beers.  Those are also the sort of beer that's often on happy hour.  They're fine drinkin' beers, but charging $7 for them and being uppity about it only makes them seem better to people who have no idea what's going on.  This makes the facade of snottiness but actual ignorance, and the other reviewer's consternation, even more amusing. \nA bar behind a Walmart attached to an ice hockey den in my neighborhood, the Icehouse Tavern, has better beers and a better selection, though in bottles.  The Icehouse Tavern also has chill, friendly service that's expertly executed.  Wound-be hipsters looking to enjoy a good beer and praise an interesting venue would do well to go there instead.  Boulders on Broadway in Tempe has better beers on tap and friendly, sane service, even when it's crazy.  Popago Brewing in Scottsdale has better beers on tap and knows theirs beers and though the service isn't fantastic, it's genuine and they know their stuff.  Taste of Tops in Tempe is five stars across the board -- beer, service, ambiance (okay, maybe only four on ambiance -- but still vastly better).  The Filmbar across the street from Angel's Trumpet has some good beers and ambiance and feels a lot less like a college bar where the inexperienced serve the inexperienced in droves.  The Roosevelt, not far away, though often packed, has great ambiance (it's an old brick house in a historic neighborhood), some good beers, though fewer taps, and significantly more accomplished servers.\nPlaces like Angels Trump House are able to pack a crowd, but that's it.  They do a disservice to good beer by pretentiously, rudely, and amateurishly serving mostly mediocre brews.  As an apparently independent outfit, I would expect better, not worse, than miserable, cynical attempts at beer snobbery for the sake of it, such as Yard House.  I fear that places like this will just keep awesome establishments that deal in craft beer from setting up in Phoenix.", "type": "review", "business_id": "41j3GB7M-Lwq284Pfb9zgw"}

No coffee, no club soda, no iced tea.  Only offer a handful of wines. They do have a soda fountain somewhere.  I get it. It's a craft brew pub.  No mixed drinks. Only serve the frothy and fermented.  I support that.  But have some decent non-alcoholic bevvys on hand: iced tea, sparkling waters, and good coffee.

The place has to do something about the acoustics - it is far too loud to be able to carry on a conversation. And, the only other negative was the lighting.

I love that its constantly changing drawing you back to keep trying new beers. But I work downtown and have been wanting to go here for since they opened. They close at 11 everyday other than Friday and Saturday when they close at 12. They've been closed every night that I've tried to go. This past Friday I walked by just past 12 and they said they were closed. Even with a lot of people still inside. A lot of people heading to the Turf. \n\nI finally had a chance to stop in when they were open. As I said the beer selection was amazing. I had no intentions on eating there since the menu seemed a little too far out there. We ate anyways. I had the nutter sandwich. Sounded interesting. Pb&j with raspberry-chipotle jam, banana, bacon and marshmallow cream. It was ok, but tasted like candle wax. I'm not sure why. My wife had the stroganoff burger. Not bad, the bun was burnt and cheese not melted. None of the food was hot. Fries were really good though even at room temp.  Their homemade ketchup tastes like sweetened marinara. \n\nI would still recommend trying Angels Trumpet, but only for beers or even their wines on tap. Dine somewhere else. \n\nWe sat at a table inside and didn't have any issues with their service and didn't mind the noise. We could still talk to each other without yelling.

I go to a lot of places.  Some try to be too ambitious and fall on the face with their overly-complicated menus. Some try to take things down to a more simple idea and end up overshooting, making everything bland and too usual.\n\nAngel Trumpet has no such flaws.  They're also not perfect, but I can justify that 5-star review.  \n\nLet's get it out of the way:  The chairs suck, they're kind of uncomfortable and rigid.  The beer prices are kind of what we like to call \"astronomical\" for a mostly poor beanly-fellow such as myself.  The food can come out a little slow.  It's all true, if someone else said it in another review, I can back that all up.\n\nAnd yet, I don't really give a damn.  This is a local joint in downtown Phoenix peddling 31 different beers that are always rotating.  Not a \"regular\" beer in sight.  It's what downtown Phoenix has been clamoring for.  And if you're coming to an ale house, you're coming to drink first and eat later.\n\nStill, I like their food.  Stroganoff burger...oh man.  I'm such a sour cream whore and, I love my food saucy and wet but I hate soggy stuff.  The bun stood up to the stroganoff sauce and the sour cream and the mushrooms and the juicy medium-cooked beef perfectly.  The 810 sandwich with hand-pulled turkey works in spite of the overly-southwestern theme (pull back on the adobo a bit, it can taste like the restaurant equivalent of \"taco seasoning\" that every white person I know uses to make tacos) because each of the ingredients is high-quality.  The bread is fresh and crisped.  The ribbon chips are amazingly thin.\n\nPeople have griped and complained for literally decades that downtown doesn't have any neat, laid-back places to have a beer and be a human, with most places downtown still ready to serve the post-5pm cattle herd and nothing more.  Here you have a genuine Phoenix experience.  Don't gripe too much.  Soak it up.  \n\nWe'll will be back there.  Will you?", "type": "review", "business_id": "41j3GB7M-Lwq284Pfb9zgw"}

It takes them out of their comfort zone. It is for this very reason that I am giving it 5 stars. Most places are exactly the same as everywhere else and kudos to Angel's Trumpet for daring to be different.\n\nI love the beer selection, I love that I haven't heard of most of them. I also love the food. The onion and blue cheese quesadilla was amazing. The bison BLT in a blanket was a knockout and the avocado salad made my vegetarian girlfriend very happy. The service has been good all 3 visits.\n\nWhat really blew my mind during the last visit was the quality of the music. When a bar plays The Jam, Madness, The Specials, The Clash, Talking Heads, Depeche Mode, The Police, The Beat, I know there is someone in charge (even if only in charge of the music) with good taste.\n\nOne suggestion - the chalkboard on the patio should be raised. It's too low when people sit at the table right next to it and difficult to read. Other than that one, very minor inconvenience, this place is unique and it rocks.

I opted for the grilled cheese (I know...I like cheese sometimes, don't hate.) that came with pesto and tomatoes, fries and a side of house-made roasted tomato ketchup.  It was all divine. M'lady had the vegetable pizza, which came topped with lots of seasonal veggies (watermelon radishes, squash, fingerling potatoes, mushrooms, onions, and more).  It was equally as pleasing to the palate.  Our friends ordered the special, fish tacos.  Came with two tacos filled with fish and fried calamari and toppings, rice and beans.  Spicy, but very good and flavorful.\n\nBack to the beers for a moment:  I only ordered the single bevvy, but our friends ordered a flight (any six beers of their choosing) and it came in a cute little muffin pan:)  Kudos all around from the decor to the food!

The beer was good, and the server we had was good, but the food was awful and the experience we had with the manager was what ultimately ruined the experience.  We ordered wings, and a quesadilla.  The wings looked and tasted either like they had been sitting out for an hour, or they were deep fried to a crisp.  The quesadilla had decent flavor, but was only about 1/8 of an inch thick and had very little filling, definitely not worth the $7 for such a small amount of food.  There are a lot of places in downtown I can go and get full for $7, this was like a 3 bite snack.  \n\nBut, since we live downtown, and we like to support our local businesses, and considering the fact that they had only been open a week or so, we thought we'd give some helpful constructive feedback to the management in hopes they might improve.  So we asked to talk to a manager to tell him about the food.\n\nSo this guy comes over and we tell him the wings taste way too overdone, and the quesadilla tasted alright but was a poor value at $7.  We told him we were local, we were polite, and that we knew they had only been open a week and we  wanted to help them work out the kinks.  \n\nThe manager immediately got really defensive and tried to tell us that the wings were fine (and that everyone else in the place who ordered them loved them)  and that they only use the very best ingredients and that's why the quesadilla was so expensive.  Then he basically tried to tell us that we were wrong and that there was no way that the food could have been that bad.  We were just trying to help a local place succeed, and this guy put a really bad taste in our mouth. \n\nArguing with a customer and trying to convince them that the bad food they just ate wasn't really bad is a perfect example of how not to run a restaurant.  All he had to do was simply say \"thank you for the honest feedback, we will consider your recommendations, and we would love it if you would come back and have a free appetizer on us so that you can see we're committed to improving.\"  We would have been back a dozen times by now, and told all our friends about it.  But instead he was a jerk.  \n\nWe thought about coming back again after a few months, but every time we think about it, we just think of the manager.  And besides, there are lots of other great places in downtown Phoenix that have better, cheaper food, and good beer too.

My first trip hit that medium perfectly (little did I know!) with the result that my Outlaw Burger was Revelatory!Burger, OMG!Burger, SeraphimSingPraises!Burger.

And in that context, the space is really cool -- it's like a coffeehouse in that there's a sense of community gathering regardless of which specific party you're with.\n\nMy second trip was on a swamped day, and my medium burger was well-done. The kitchen's still working with quality ingredients -- the buns are very fine buns -- so even a meh burger is still a pretty good burger and worth the $9. But flights of angels did not actually sing over this burger.\n\nOn the up side, the kitchen positively coated the ribbon chips with red and black pepper, and since I love spicy food, that was so far beyond amazing that I considered asking for more, then decided not to push my luck.\n\nRumor has it that one can ask for take-out and trot the food across the street to FilmBar.", "type": "review", "business_id": "41j3GB7M-Lwq284Pfb9zgw"}

I can go anywhere to grab a tasteless lager, a slightly hopped pale or predictable red ale. With the recent explosion of craft over the past few years, I figured that so many of these places would pop up and easily be done correctly...WRONG! While many bars attempt to have a \"craft beer garden\" they still play it safe and that's unfortunate. ATAH does not, and that's why I was happy to give it my official seal of approval.\n\nWalking in, I had no idea what to expect. I almost drove past the place and wasn't entirely certain which door to enter through (I think there was only one but I don't rememeber it being marked very well). Upon entering, we weren't greeted by anyone but the bar is where I head anyways. Simple concept inside, clean and hard to miss what's on tap. We ate a BBQ chicken sandwich, it was average...but I wasn't there for food. The beer selection was fantastic, offering a wide variety of brew and probably something to please everyone...and with 30+ taps, if you can't find something you like, that's your own problem. I loved the fact that they offered a handful of beer I had never seen on tap anywhere in Phoenix before, which is something pretty rare around here. This tells me what whoever is running this place isn't afraid to charge that extra buck or two for something a true beer lover will be happy to see on tap.\n\nAlso, I must mention one more thing I liked about this place. While AZ brewers and Crescent Crown sit around and try to push this whole \"Drink Local\" campaign in our faces, this place had two local taps. I thought that was just enough for what they could afford to offer based on tap real estate and respect local brewers. There is nothing more frustrating than a bar that thinks it's a good idea to gather tons of AZ beers and serve them all in one location. Here is a tip to any bar owners who think AZ beer is good for service: AZ beer is NOT good for service.\n\nGreat place and I will be back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "41j3GB7M-Lwq284Pfb9zgw"}

I mean, 31 craft DRAFT beers in one place in DT PHX... done and done! Even if you're not a beer aficionado, tell your server what you like and they'll make suggestions as to what you should try, AND are always spot-on. Last time I was there I had the Stone Enjoy By IPA... one of my new favorite beers of all time.\n\nNow of the 5 times here, 2 times my party has ordered food. The first time I did not like my sandwich at all, and my husband thought his was okay.  I liked the names and ideas but felt it was executed poorly. \n\nThe second time here we started at one table with a handful of people and had Jake as our server (we've had him in other DT PHX restaurants and he rocks -- as always). Jake is great, friendly, knowledgeable, quick, honest... just an all around awesome guy. Then our party grew and we cashed out and took a table outside. It got busy, we got ignored for the better part of half an hour -- but then when we finally saw our new server he was very attentive going forward. Our food was delayed and we felt there was a lack of HONEST communication. Honest meaning don't tell me the food is coming right now then come out another 40 minutes later and tell me the same thing, just tell me how it is. Our server finally got a manager involved (Waylan - sp?) and let me tell you, he was our saving grace. He communicated the issue and was quick to fix it. It was to the point that we were talking about never going in again and he changed our minds. Our food came out after he got involved, it was great, everyone was super attentive to us (we weren't looking to be babied, that's now how I roll).  I know it's frustrating when something goes wrong and you don't have much control over it but you as a manager/server get the brunt of the angry guests.\n\nSo over all, my experience at this place has went from meh, to oh no never again, to great, thanks to the customer service provided by the management team. We'll be in again soon for a delicious beer  or five, and I will give Waylan a high five when I see him, and we'll ask to sit in Jake's section. :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "41j3GB7M-Lwq284Pfb9zgw"}

I must admit that the only thing I have been WOW'd by were the sliders.\n\nYou definitely should give this place a shot and do yourself a favor by ordering a flight of beers to find that one you truly enjoy.", "type": "review", "business_id": "41j3GB7M-Lwq284Pfb9zgw"}

Talk about taking some run of the mill items and reinventing them in such a great way! We got a variety of items to try/share. Word to the wise:the portions are quite big. Not some tiny hipster plates that barely touch your appetite. The warm meat platter was amazing. A variety of sausages and sauces that were all spot on. A great way to start off with the amazing selection of pints. Our platter didn't come out right away as it got lost in the shuffle, but our waiter was more than apologetic so I can't really fault them on such a busy night. We also tried the Churchill grilled cheese with spam as an add-on. I can't wait to have this again! We used to have this in Minnesota a lot, but the high quality cheeses they use and bread really make this an amazing dish. My friend had the Nutter Fluffer with bacon add-on. Nutella, bananas, bacon, peanut butter, marshmallow cream. I'm probably missing a couple of items but man was this done right. Every bite was an adventure as each flavor came out. My wife got the mash tacos (I forget the exact name) mashed sweet potatoes, cheese, pesto in a fried shell. More of a quesadilla than taco but again....simply amazing.

Let me start with the positive our server was super awesome and knowledgeable about beer as well as really friendly. If I were to rate the place strictly on the service it would be an easy 5 star review, however there were some things that just didn't measure up.\n   We found a table outside and the weather was perfect, so that was a plus. We proceeded to order a \"flight\" of beer. Which was 6 different samples of selections from the 25 plus handles that are rotated frequently (I think daily, but I could be wrong on that). Here is the first part of the reason for the 2 stars. There are 2 boards to read the selection of draughts that are being featured, and a menu that describes what each of the types of beers are for example  A \"Lager\" is..... or A \"Stout\" is..... However there is no correlation that I could decipher that would tell you what \"type\" of beer that the featured name stood for, so let's say number 22 on the board was Witte...If you are a beer rookie there was no way to know what type it was. This causes one of at least two dilemmas, you can either 1. ask the server what type of beer each of the 25 or so types are (which....\"Ain't nobody got time for that\" :)  or you can play a little \"Russian Beerlette\" and just hope for the best, at any rate there are some specific types of beer that I just do not enjoy, and I didn't want the server to have to reel off all of the specifics of each beers that was on the board. I love the idea of the constantly rotating types of draught, but they need to figure out a better delivery system for the patron. The other part of the review was based on the appetizers that we had, one of which was the pretzels. Maybe I am americanized and have been spoiled to food a certain way, but I like my pretzels soft all the way through and really doughy (if that's a word) and theirs just weren't that. The pretzels were not very moist and the selection of cheese and mustard was ok at best. I really hate giving two stars, but I gotta be honest about my experience.\n Great concept, great server, poor execution....I might try again in a few months and see if they changed anything.", "type": "review", "business_id": "41j3GB7M-Lwq284Pfb9zgw"}

The glasses weren't that cold either and by the time the food came the beer was warm.I will go back just not on a busy night and will ask to sit outside!.Cheers!", "type": "review", "business_id": "41j3GB7M-Lwq284Pfb9zgw"}

I assume it's b/c they were very busy.\n\nThe tap options were endless and as others have mentioned, rotate as they go throughout the evening.  It's a great way to keep you coming back for more!  They have a beautiful patio with a lot more dining tables and that is where we got to sit.  I love eating outside in perfect AZ weather!\n\nWe got the veggie flatbread which was DEEEEELISH and can I just say ...Oh. Em. Gee with regard to the wings.  They were roasted to perfection and served with three sauces on the side, which was ingenious! I really enjoyed that touch so I could mix and match the sauce.  I am still drooling over the amazingness that was the wings!  Get them.\n\nThe beer options were also wonderful and the price point is average.  I would have spent more money here but I was jet-lagged and had to get back to the hotel before I passed out at my table after my two beers.

She took my drink order and gave me a menu. \n\nI am reviewing the food and service; I am not reviewing the beer as I have not tried any. The menu has so many great things to choose from. The Brewlee Burger is what caught my eyes. It consists of many things including (but not limited to): beef (or pork/chicken - your choice), pepper bacon, red sweet onions, chipotle mayo, spinach leaves, romaine lettuce, pepperjack cheese, and an over-easy egg on top. How does that NOT sound good? The fries are not frozen; they are real potatoes. They are seasoned well, crispy, and come with a homemade dipping sauce (not store-bought ketchup). \n\nI put in my order and connected to the FREE WiFi to do some browsing. My burger was ready within ten to fifteen minutes. I knew that it would become one of my favorite burgers in Phoenix as I took a huge first bite. The flavors danced around on my palate and it began to rejoice. The burger is a great combination of spiciness and sweetness. The price was very reasonable for an enormous, outstanding burger and a large, crispy portion of fries. \n\nThe service was remarkable!

I've been living in the suburbs of Phoenix for 20 years and I never thought of the downtown area as being a \"happening\" place. When we got off I-10 and proceeded south, there was traffic and people every where. We were really surprised.\n\nWe went to Angel's Trumpet on a Friday night and arrived around 7 p.m. The wait time was about 15 minutes and we were able to pass the time in comfortable chairs on the back patio. A waitress came by and offered us water or drinks while we were waiting. Even though it was about 110 degrees that day, the misters kept the outside area cool so it was comfortable when the first available table was outside. \n\nBeer:\nThe beer selection was great and they seemed to have various styles for everyone. I love amber beers, and although they only had one selection (Sunset Amber), it was a tasty beer. As is typical of most bar establishments, the beer selection was heavier on the IPA, porter, and wheat style beers. My boyfriend and friends tried several kinds (unfortunately I was the DD so I couldn't try as many) and they enjoyed each one. A particular favorite was Sculplin IPA. If it wasn't so hot outside I may have tried one of their wines \"on draft.\"\n\nFood:\nAmazing flavor combinations! It took us a long time to decide what we wanted to eat and none of us were disappointed with our food choices. I had a sandwich (\"Bingo\")  from the daily special menu with french fries which were served with marinara sauce instead of ketchup (delicious). We had the poptarts which is why we tried Angel's Trumpet in the first place. The seasonal poptart was bourbon peach which had a type of oatmeal crumble on the top (no frosting). It was delicious - flaky dough with fantastic flavor. \n\nService:\nNot great for us, but tables around us had much better service. Angel's Trumpet was busy, but our waiter was either not very organized or just slow compared to the waitress buzzing around to the other tables around us. I wish we would have had her instead. For instance, a table behind us on the patio was sat at least five minutes after us and we hadn't even been greeted yet. Then the people who were seated behind us had drinks and food (appetizer) before our beers even arrived. Our slow waiter was very irritating.\n\nOverall:\nIt's a long drive downtown just for food, but we will definitely be back (hopefully with the stellar waitress and not the slow waiter). We all enjoyed our time at Angel's Trumpet and liked the energy of that area in general. It was also fun to see so many different ages congregating in one place.", "type": "review", "business_id": "41j3GB7M-Lwq284Pfb9zgw"}

This place suffers from the more is better and more bacon is even better mentality that is in vogue with those that don't understand balance.  The meat pizza was good but over topped which made the crust go soft and bacon dominated all of the meats.  My wife had the summer berry salad special.  She liked it but said the dressing was too oily and didn't have enough vinegar.  \n\nI had the Garfield which is a turkey wrap with bacon and cranberry aioli.  The only flavor was bacon.  I really missed the cranberry flavor.  A simpler version done at SunUp is much more balanced.\n\nThe beer selection was skewed bizarrely to +7% ABV beers.  There were only a couple of \"sessionable\" beers available.  The ESB I tried was flat and tasted more like a brown.  \n\nThe house ketchup it terrible - it isn't sweetened and tasted like canned tomato paste.  It is bitter and sour and really ruined the decent fries that came with my sandwich.  If the place could lose some illusions and pull back a bit it could be a great spot.\n\nOh, the place only had a few tables of people and noise level was horrible, maybe that is why the waitress missed my iced tea order, although the staff seemed to have no problem talking to each other for long stretches.

What I mean is its where all the hipsters hangout.  It's all good!  I actually enjoy the atmosphere here.  It's not over the top nor do I have to dress my ass off - though I do anyways!  Like most hipster bars, I feel like I should ride my bike with a banana seat except I don't have bike nor would I get one with a banana seat.  \n\nAnyways, I ordered a special tonight, which was called the Garfield.  Not sure why really I guess the Chef's name was Mr. Garfield maybe.  It was pretty much a low carb tortilla wrapped with turkey and the fixins' along with some fries.  I didn't think much of it.  My friend ordered the Smokin Legs, which was roasted chicken legs, but she got 3.  It was obviously a lot for her since I think she only ate one and nibbled on her sides.  Needless to say, I'm not a fan of their food!\n\nThen again this is an Ale house!  I really do like this place because their selection of crafted beers.  Daily changes one what is brewing so that's awesome.  Instead of your usual Stella, Bud, or Peroni, Ale house offers some funky ass names and taste I can't describe.  Over 31 selections so it can be overwhelming, but take your time Angel Trumpet isn't going away anytime soon.

On any particular night you can leave your house walk into a few bars/restaurants and end up in some fabulous places.  One I frequent often is Angel's Trumpets Ale House.  I belly up to this bar for 2 reasons: \n1). With 30 some beers on tap that rotate often, (most within the same night!)  I ALWAYS have options. I appreciate a beer adventure - trying as many as possible - so that I can broaden my beer drinking experience/knowledge.  I've found some great favorites here (ie Hopslam, Pranqster, omg GULP) It's like bringing all of the nation's best beer to one conference, located right here at Angel's Trumpets.\n\n2). Space. There is lots of it. The spread is bright and open and with contemporary, upcycled decor - you really can't go wrong. Have a large group of people? No prob! Easy to accommodate. And with that patio in the back...give me a break! This massive patio (now with misters) is perfect for enjoying evenings under the Phoenix skyline. \n\nBut the Beer and Space can't sell this place alone. Angel's Trumpets is missing something -an energy, a feeling, an emotional attachment that is found so easily in other places like Lost Leaf, Crescent, or Brat Haus, Four Peaks and even Papago Brewery.\nSometimes I feel like I'm eating in a big cafeteria hall (unless I'm on the patio) in which every conversation bounces off the walls and floors. There is never any music playing - which blows as I feel it should be a crucial part of any outing. After all, music, beer, art and food are such important aspects of the downtown culture.\nI'm still yearning for more - and I'm patiently waiting.", "type": "review", "business_id": "41j3GB7M-Lwq284Pfb9zgw"}

I had the Fun-Guy flat bread pizza... very rich and fit for two. I chose this because of the mushrooms and goat cheese... it could have used a lot more Fun-Guys and some spice! My company had the fish tacos which I definitely will get the next time I go! Possibly on my top 5 list of fish tacos and I'm originally from California! And I'm Mexican!

Denying myself some beer from the nitro taps at Angels has been agony so I came back in against my best judgement.\n\nI sat at the bar for a while before the bartender acknowledged me, no biggie, I was narrowing down my selection anyway.  I started to become annoyed though when he kept pouring tasters to the people next to me without even acknowledging me.

I tell myself to let it go, it's only a taste, just get your beer and move on.  But I couldn't get my beer, no. I had to sit there and listen to the customer next to me tell the bartender about all the beers in Germany she has tried. When that long winded b!tch took a breath I stole my chance to order a beer. He looked at me very annoyed and nodded his head and continued his conversation.  Then he continues to pour more tasters for the people he is having a conversation with.  Did you get that?  A paying customer tried to order a beer and instead he poured his friends more freebies.  I walked out.  When I was leaving I saw a gentleman that looked like he was important, I asked him if he was in charge and he said he was.

Beer was great, service was so-so, food was not good. The ambience was loud and lively, super hipster-friendly, and they have cool wooden tables. Nice, we thought; but the food sucks.\n\nVisit #2: Gave it a second shot, figured we ordered wrong. Nope. Food sucked again. I like good pub food, and I like to try interesting combos like bacon & pesto, things marinated in beer, and gamey appetizers like buffalo meat or venison something or other. They have all these things, and we didn't like any. We ordered a few items, and the waiter said they were out of several ingredients b/c they were changing their menu. Place was still packed, beer flight was interesting. \n\nVisit #3: We saw some killer pics online of their \"tv dinners\" and succumbed to our boredom and gave this place another try. Maybe the new menu was better, or they got a different chef or something. Nope. Food sucked again, and waiter was dull and silent. That's a grand total of around 4 appetizers, 8 entrees, and about a six-pack worth of crafty beers. Nothing great here food wise. \n\nTips: Stick to just getting beer. They have no ketchup, only a tomato-paste thing for your fries/tots. Wait staff looked like they would rather be across the street at Filmbar.", "type": "review", "business_id": "41j3GB7M-Lwq284Pfb9zgw"}

It's pretty much the closest thing to a microbrewery you'll find in downtown Phoenix.  Tons of beers (and some wines) on tap and the choices always rotate.  This time around I got a Hefe from a brewer in the Czech Republic.  For lunch I got what was essentially a BLT on steroids with super thick bacon, lettuce, tomato, as well as pesto.  Really nice compliment to the beer.  The place wasn't too busy since its a Saturday afternoon, but I'm told this place is packed with downtown workers during weekday happy hours.  They have a nice outdoor patio that is ideal when the weather permits, though I kind of wish they'd put something else out there like cornhole toss, a live music stage, or something along those lines.  Overall, the food is pretty good and the service I've gotten here is pretty friendly.  The food and ambiance won't knock your socks off, but the beer selection is really hard to beat.

A friend suggested Angels Trumpet Ale House. \n\nWe arrived about 9:30pm on a Saturday night, fully expecting a crowd. We were relieved to see there were many open tables and our party of 7 was sat right away. Great! We're off to a good start! After studying the menu and deciding what we wanted (we were starving and thirsty), we patiently waited for a server to come and greet us. 10 minutes went by. No server. 15 minutes. No server. 20 minutes. No server. \nWhile I would usually be understanding if it was busy (I used to be a server myself, so I have a high patience level), MULTIPLE servers were walking past our table looking like they had absolutely nothing to do. One male server was actually strolling around whistling with not a care in the world. We were absolutely in shock at the lack of acknowledgement we received by anyone other than the hostess. After waiting 25 minutes and still not being approached we all got up and left. On the way out, the hostess said cheerfully, \"Thanks for coming in! Have a great night!\". Sure, we probably would have had a great night if we actually would have been served. \n\nIt takes a LOT for me to complain about service. As I said before, I have been a server, and I know how stressful it can be...when it is BUSY. This place was NOT busy and had plenty of servers. We ended up leaving frustrated and hungry. \n\nWe will not be giving this place a second chance, nor can I recommend it to others after the experience we had. \n\nHorrible service.

It was insanely packed and so we grabbed a couple chairs in the back corner.  Our waitress was still very accommodating and served us quickly with beer and drinks.  Don't ask me which of the many beers we ordered because I can't remember...\n\n...Because all I can remember is how insanely divine and delicious our dessert was!  We ordered the salted caramel flatbread that came highly recommended to us by a friend (see my picture I posted, #147).  It is completely homemade on a nice thin crispy flatbread.  Peanut Butter.  Caramel.  Marshmallow fluff.  Chocolate Chips.  Honey.  Pretzels.  If you aren't drooling yet, I feign to say there might be something wrong with your salivary glands or taste-buds.  \n\nI want to head back sometime to soon to try their beer, TV dinner night, and enjoy a table with some good friends.

On the most recent outing, I tried a gingerbread lager which hit the seasonal spot.\n\nI haven't met an item on the menu that I don't like. I could go on about the pretzels- amazing!

It's like a big mixture of things from around your kitchen that you would make and scarf down when you've had one or two-welve to many.

If that brand of gluttony isn't your thing, try any of the sandwiches and you'll be totally satisfied-- the food here is a major highlight, no question.  \n\nI'm a wine person so the place gets one demerit for the very limited (and usually not-so-tasty) wine selection.  But because it is billed as an \"ale house\" I can't get too picky about it.  My beer-guzzling family raves about the beer selection and the flights that let you try a little bit of everything.  If they're happy with it, it must be grand!  \n\nThe atmosphere is my favorite thing about the place.  The lighting is perfect, it's spacious but cozy, and there are a variety of seating options including a great outdoor space.  It's great for small gatherings and large happy hour outings alike.   \n\nA few words of advice:\n\n1.  TV dinners start at 6pm and they are limited quantity so don't expect to show up for a late dinner and nab one-- they'll be sold out!\n\n2.  ATAH is closed on Mondays! \n\n3.  They don't open until 3pm Tuesday-Thursday so don't expect to grab lunch or an early happy hour during the week.  \n\nCheers!", "type": "review", "business_id": "41j3GB7M-Lwq284Pfb9zgw"}

As my visiting NYC friend said, it's practically free _ or at least a killer bargain. It is a little bit like Christmas morning when you look and see on Facebook what Chef Brian will be serving for TV dinner. Past entrees have included fried chicken, meatloaf sandwich, pulled pork sandwich and chicken skewers. They always come with sides (thank god there's only enough to fill those little TV tray compartments) and a dessert. \n\nI would already be a fan of Angels without the creative TV dinner nights. Even though I don't drink, the atmosphere here is fun, lively and so not pretentious. And it's always fun to people-watch. I used to think it was dominated by hipsters but I see white-collar office workers, men showing up in a bowtie and jacket look like possibly an ASU professor. It's very rare that you encounter someone crazy boozy. Also, the patio is a treat. They turn on the misters in the summer and they have a board out there as well with what's on tap. \n\nThe comfort food on the regular menu is amazing as well, the pizza and the sandwiches (you have to have at least once the nutter--peanut butter on sourdough with raspberry chipotle jam and marshmallow fluff and for an extra $1, peppered bacon). They also have big, fried spud tacos with sweet potatoes. A little too spicy for me but otherwise delicious. My only beef (or should I say pork?) is why on Earth would you serve spam sliders? I tried one on opening night and I could barely make it through half. Not worth the skyrocketing sodium levels. For the desserts, the \"pizza\" with marshmallow, pretzels and chocolate is so-so. But the housemade poptarts, I could inhale. A definite treat worth getting!\n\nThis has become one of my go-to spots for visitors or if I feel like I deserve a treat for the week.

Yeah that compressed, salty, meat from a can.   \n\nOk, ok...I realized I may be the only one excited about this, ESPECIALLY since they are known for their FABULOUS rotating beer selection, 30+ on tap at any one time.  They also offer some wines on tap as well.  Order up a flight or 2 (6 tasters of  your choosing of any of the listed beers) and expand your beer palate or go for a pint of your favorite. Their menu is quite complementary to their beer offerings. \n\nOk, now back to the Spam.  Now trust me on this,  when Spam is done right it can be quite tasty.  They do it very well here.  Their Spam Sliders, as a meal if you enjoy Spam as much as I do, or nicely shared.  It is fried to crisp perfection and served on toasted Hawaiian bread  with a Sriracha mayo coleslaw.   My other Spammy favorite is a Sammy, the Churchill Grilled Cheese, you pay a lil extra for the crispy fried Spam goodness (or bacon, you really can't go wrong here) but it goes so well with the melty deliciousness of smoked mozzarella and fontina cheese.  \n\nYou have to come and check out their Tuesday TV dinner meal.  A TV dinner like compartment tray comes to you filled with yummies that vary every week (Main dish, side or 2, and a dessert). These are not Hungry Man meals  but you won't leave hungry.   Make sure to follow them on Facebook to see what they are serving up that Tuesday and get there early because it has been know to be a sell out option.   \n\nI love this place, but, \"Why only 4 stars?\", you ask.  Well, it gets quite loud in the main restaurant area.  Every sound kind of carries and you spend your time speaking loudly to have a conversation.

I recently attended a \"Cider School\" here on a weekend before they opened for business that day.  In attendance were Woodchuck and J.K. Scrumpy brewers/reps.  We tasted 6 types of apples commonly used in cider making. Tasted several ciders, including some that were not even on the market  yet. Oh don't let me forget the food pairing.

I should have read more of the bad ones because unfortunately they better reflect my experience.\n\nThe boyfriend and I visited on a Friday night. It was busy so we put our name on the list - no problem. The hostess said it would be about 20 minutes. It was very crowded by the host stand so we went and waited outside, right by the door. 20 minutes came and went and we never saw her come out so we went inside. After a minute or so, the hostess came up to us and said \"oh, I couldn't find you guys. I can seat you now.\" Couldn't find us? We were RIGHT outside the front door. When there are 20 people waiting in the \"lobby\" wouldn't you think to look outside? \n\nSo she takes us to our table but did not bring menus so she said she'd be right back. She never came back. The waitress came up to greet us and we had to ask her for menus. She must not have liked that we asked for menus because she was crabby and short with us the rest of the time we were there. (Actually, I assume it's because we didn't order beer. Or she was just a B.)\n\nBoyfriend ordered the burger and I ordered the grilled cheese with spam. We both got fries. The fries were meh, the ketchup was weird - more like pasta sauce and the sandwiches were pretty meh too. They weren't bad but they weren't great. They were forgettable. Writing about my sandwich now I honestly can't really remember it vey well. Not a good thing.\n\nAfter we finished it took forever to get our bill and they never cleared our plates even though we were clearly done eating. We ended up just shoving them to the side and left with barely a thank you from our waitress.\n\nNeedless to say between the crappy service and the sub-par food we won't be back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "41j3GB7M-Lwq284Pfb9zgw"}

Very casual and fun place to go for dinner. I highly recommend this place to anyone.  \n\nThe only meal I didn't like very much was the sausage plate.  The matador sandwich is my favorite.  But if I go on a Tuesday I definitely go for the TV dinner.  Burgers are also great!  Pizza is better at other restaurants, not my favorite thing here.

Yum!) I have heard good things about the TV Dinners on Tuesday, so maybe I'll have to try that out. I don't think there's much of a happy hour either, maybe a dollar or two off a beer?\n\nThe service- Almost always painful, and painful to watch around me, especially at an outside table. Pretty slow, negligent, and they don't seem to care. The strangest thing is nearly every time I have been here, I have been asked to close out so the server can \"get their drink on, too.\" Multiple occasions, all different servers. Were they trained to say this? I get it, but it's also a bit lame. \n\nIf you're really lucky, the bar service can be a little better.

Had a blast with good people and tried probably too many beers.  Thankfully I wasn't driving :)  The place was slammed SLAMMED, but some friends had already been there for awhile and had been able to get a table before I showed up so there was no waiting for me.  Straight to the beer!  \n\nThat said, there's a lot of craft beers that you may never have heard of.  Do the sampler, try as much as possible, that's my philosophy.  Some of this stuff will catch up with you.  The Beast was 19% ABV!   Wut?  :)\n\n Glass wall at the end of the huge cooler gives me something to stare at and drool over.   Love the huge outdoor patio.    Lots of patio heaters out there.   \n\nParking can be a challenge.  \n\nThe only thing I can think of that might be undesirable is that there are homeless people hanging out just on the other side of the back wall to the patio.  They even have mattresses and junk out there, so it appears as if some of them sleep out there.  I'm not so worried about them, other than that they lend trashiness to the area.  My girlfriend, on the other hand, was a bit uncomfortable with going by herself out to her car to get something she forgot, and I can't blame her, so I went instead.  \n\nGreat spot, except for the very limited parking, which might force you to have to interact with the homeless people.", "type": "review", "business_id": "41j3GB7M-Lwq284Pfb9zgw"}

Never had a complaint about service. This last time though we took a table outside since the weather was too nice not to take advantage of of the one table that happened to open up outside. Felt lucky considering it seemed to be pretty busy at the time.\n\nWe were greeted by our server promptly and provided with water just as quick.  we requested some sample tastings of a few brews and per usual I always appreciate their diligence in offering for us to taste our beer selections before we had them.\n\nThan onto our food orders.  Having a full lunch just before our ride I had decided to stick to my 1 beer for the time we were there. My friends needed food and ordered the wild BLT (Alligator) and some pretzels. I am an avid fan of this place so I made a point to try their plates.\n\nThe alligator brat was amazing. would only suggest that it be in a bun rather than a wrap??? wraps seem to better accommodate meats that area cut or sliced. Just my opinion. \n\nThe pretzels were great! I am always astounded when I go out to eat and a restaurant cannot gets pretzels and cheese right?? I know I am not the only one thinking this. The portion size was generous so no complaints there either. the ketchup is made in house = Awesome. Can get some real flavors out of it rather than vinegar and sugar.\n\nI only have to knock this review down a star since this time being sat outside I did see a bit of a lag in service times between our food order and drink refills. Nothing we felt we needed to complain about since we were in no rush that evening but I did notice a few tables scanning the floor for their server more than a few times.\n\nside note: last time I had visited the bar was with my roommate and having showed up to an empty restaurant mid day we expected prompt service but were quickly derailed by a bar crawl that came in filling the floor from shoulder to shoulder and taking priority over our service. Was a bit annoyed but again was in no huge rush. but still, Priorities!!\n\nLove the place and the brew selections! ill be visiting again no doubt!", "type": "review", "business_id": "41j3GB7M-Lwq284Pfb9zgw"}

I don't know if any of that's true, but I grew up with a very uncanny respect for this floral bush.   \n\nWhen I heard of a pub called Angel's Trumpet Ale House in dtphx, it brought back all those memories of mysterious curiosity. I had to get there as soon as possible! \n\nIt took me six months... \n\nAnyhow, I finally got to ATAH and it was a cool place. They had a good beer selection, and I was lucky enough to end up here on TV dinner night. What is TV dinner night, you might ask. Well, it's just how it sounds. For only $7, you get a meal served TV dinner style. \n\nIt's pretty much TV dinner quality too, but I got a good laugh from the whole experience. The presentation actually reminded me more of a school cafeteria lunch than TV dinner. Either way, there was a certain childish joy that came from eating that meal served on a tray with each food item separated into its own little trench.\n\nI can definitely say I'll be coming back to Angel's Trumpet.

Cool, open decor inside with a long chalkboard displaying a tempting list of great craft beers.  Part of the fun of drinking and dining here is anxiously watching as one of the staff removes one beer from the list and replaces it with a new one.  \n\nAnd the food -- so good.  I had the wings and pretzels (just appetizers for me this time) but the burgers, sandwiches and pizza my coworkers had looked good too.  The wings were seasoned and flavorful, cooked perfectly and served with a unique chunky buffalo sauce, an awesome chutney and perhaps a ranch or tzatziki sauce (I wasn't a huge fan of this last one except for dipping the accompanying carrots and celery). The pretzels, though awesome, served mainly as a delivery device for the savory and delicious beer cheese sauce. \n\nLastly, don't pass up on the homemade pop tart!  Our table split one order and it took a lot of willpower for us all to avoid buying individual ones for ourselves.  That night they served apple cinnamon ones.

One of my friends asked for something to be held out of his.\n\nAfter some good conversation our food started to arrive.  Strangely, everything but the three unaltered dished with the rotating wild game came.  When our server stopped by he was surprised that they were all missing and went to investigate.  He came back and told us that the printed copy that went to the kitchen was difficult to read and looked like there was only the special request my one friend wanted even though all four were on there.  He rushed the remaining three dishes out, and they were excellent.\n\nWhen It came time to settle up our tab, our server had the manager take the three delayed meals out.  We didn't ask for that and no one in our group had any kind of complaints about the service.  He got a great tip out of it.  We had a great experience and will definitely be making more trips here.", "type": "review", "business_id": "41j3GB7M-Lwq284Pfb9zgw"}

I love the selections. There is a constant rotation of what is on tap, and the prices aren't bad at all. I supposed the chalkboard style menu can be a bit confusing, but it could be worse. Beats printing out new menus every day.\n\nI got the rodeo burger with extra bacon. HOMERUN. So awesome... the fries very were good, I liked the ketchup substitute they serve... it fit the meal perfectly. I left with a happy stomach!\n\nWe eventually moved to a table once our group showed up. Again, stuck up hipster dude wasn't much help. I picked the table I wanted when he couldn't find any words to use. \n\nOur server was soft spoken and reports from the other side of the table were that he was a bit drunk (based on smell).

When I inquired why, no one responded so I am reposting this review because I value your time and money just like I do my own.\n\nI arrived at Angel's Trumpet at 10pm to meet friends. I am always leery of new places my friends pick. They just show up without checking reviews or they listen to bad reviewers who rave about the place. Angel's Trumpet was bad except for the Beer selection which is exciting. \n\nAfter ordering my first two beers at the bar the waiter showed up and asked what I wanted at 11:00pm! An hour after I got there. When I said I was starving and wanted food I was informed that the kitchen was closed. I was busy socializing with fellow medical school classmates that I have never been out with (we call it networking since these will be my colleagues) to notice the time so when the waiter (and that's what he made me do...wait) said the kitchen was closed I was shocked to see an hour went pass. I tried to order a round of shots and was told they do not have liquor. I tried to order a glass of wine and was told that they do not have wine. I tried to order a beer and was told they were closing in 15 minutes. I asked for a beer menu and was told that they do not have menus. WHAT DO YOU HAVE! I was informed that I had to go up to the bar and read the big chalk board behind the bar for the beer selection. I pointed out, if I have to go to the bar to read the beer selection then why would I bother coming back to order through you when the bartender is right there in front of me!\n\nI grew up in the restaurant business so I know circumstances are all based on timing. I saw the four star rating this place has so clearly many people like this place and have very good experiences. Maybe it was bad timing, but for me the waiter was an HOUR LATE, THERE WAS NO MENU, AND I WAS DENIED EVERYTHING I ASKED FOR FROM THE WAITER. To make it even worse the waiter copped an attitude because he is bad at his job. I have bad mouthed this place for a month now and I will continue to bad mouth this place to everyone I meet. Having Yelp pull down my review just angers me even more and I will now post on every site I can think of in the near future.\n\nI never saw but one waiter maybe two that night.

I am already a brewery junkie so this review could be biased.  Angels Trumpet is located in the heart of downtown Phoenix and it's a great alternative eating and drinking option for the area.  \n\nI love the ambiance and decor.  It's very hipster, natural in a really good way.  The outdoor patio is amazing and just laid back wooden tables which are perfect for enjoying a delicious brew.\n\nThe beer selection is extensive.  They have 20+ unique offerings on tap at any given time.  They are unusual but high quality beers that you won't see at your typical brewery or bar.  I'm an avid craft beer drinker and all of the beer choices are always new to me.  They are written on a chalk board which makes it a little difficult to see from your table.  I suppose that's my biggest complaint.  Having something at your table would help better chose your beer of choice.  The beer is also a little more pricey than other places.  Probably about $1 more than your typical brewery but the alcohol content is higher, so I like to think it evens out.\n\nNow let's talk about the food...  YUM!  there are definitely hits and misses on the menu so just listen and plan accordingly -\n\nGrilled Cheese - if you're a fan, don't think, just get it!!  It's so good and one of the best in the city.  Get it with the bacon jam and you won't be sorry.  A delicious blend of tomato, pesto, cheese and bacon jam on crusty bread. \n\nFlatbread - good choice and good for sharing!  If they have a daily special one, go for that.  \n\nFish Tacos - was a daily special one night and really good!  One of my favorites in town so far\n\nService is great too!  Everyone is friendly and very helpful with the beer selection!  \n\nTip - visit during Happy Hour time if your life allows it - much better deals on the beer", "type": "review", "business_id": "41j3GB7M-Lwq284Pfb9zgw"}

They provide water bowls for your animals on the back patio. Great job!!!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "41j3GB7M-Lwq284Pfb9zgw"}

My lady, kid and I were in town for the Thanksgiving holiday and made plans to meet up with a friend at Angel's Trumpet (his suggestion).  We only had a little bit of time, which sucks, because I feel like we could have spent all night there.  The beer list was impressive, and featured a number of top-notch brewers that we can't get in our current hometown due to distance/distribution limitations.  I was able to select one brew I hadn't had before and one of my favorites that I can rarely get...and it was on nitro.  Good Lord, it was beautiful.  It was like angels singing...or blowing trumpets or saxophones or something.  I was pleased to learn that they rotate selections rapidly, I'm sure that if I lived nearby I would spend plenty of time there finding new beers to love.  \n\nThe atmosphere was awesome, the patio area was comfortable, and the appetizers we had were quite tasty.  Though our visit was short, our experience was very positive.  I will go back the next time I'm in town.", "type": "review", "business_id": "41j3GB7M-Lwq284Pfb9zgw"}

So so I randomly picked the 6 I thought sounded good, I wasn't disappointed but I don't know a whole lot about beer so it should have been nice to get some suggestions. So the service wasn't too spectacular but the beer was fabulous and the food was pleasant as well. I had the pretzels and wings. Personally I like that the wings come with the sauce on the side because I enjoy crispy wings and it's way cleaner.

Although I'm not a beer drinker, wine for me, we thought the reviews looked good. \nI had the Fun Guy flatbread and it was delicious and plentiful! Hubby had the grilled cheese and brisket sandwich. He eats for real and couldn't finish the whole thing.   He enjoyed a lager and I tried a couple of really good wines.  The service was exceptional and friendly.", "type": "review", "business_id": "41j3GB7M-Lwq284Pfb9zgw"}

I suppose this place will do. \n\nThe beers are great. It's much better to do beer flights though, as the slection is so broad, you always feel like you are missing out... at least I do.\n\nVegetarian food options suck. Pizza is okay. The burger looks fantastic, if only I ate burgers. I always end up getting a pretzel, I like the beer cheese sauce stuff. \n\nI wish they had some lighter small plate options. The pretzel seems to be the lightest warm option they have.", "type": "review", "business_id": "41j3GB7M-Lwq284Pfb9zgw"}
